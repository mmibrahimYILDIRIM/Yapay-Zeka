Dunlop\\'s <i>History of Fiction</i>, an\\r\\nexcellent book, dealt with a much wider matter, and perforce ceased its\\r\\ndealing just at the beginning of the most abundant and brilliant\\r\\ndevelopment of the English division. Sir Walter Raleigh\\'s <i>English\\r\\nNovel</i>, a book of the highest value for acute criticism and grace of\\r\\nstyle, stops short at Miss Austen, and only glances, by a sort of\\r\\nanticipation, at Scott. The late Mr. Sidney Lanier\\'s <i>English Novel and\\r\\nthe Principle of its Development</i> is really nothing but a laudatory\\r\\nstudy of &quot;George Eliot,&quot; with glances at other writers, including\\r\\nviolent denunciations of the great eighteenth-century men. There are\\r\\nnumerous monographs on parts of the subject: but nothing else that I\\r\\nknow even attempting the whole. I should, of course, have liked to deal\\r\\nwith so large a matter in a larger space: but one may and should\\r\\n&quot;cultivate the garden&quot; even if it is not a garden of many acres in\\r\\nextent. I need only add that I have endeavoured, not so much to give\\r\\n&quot;reviews&quot; of individual books and authors, as to indicate what Mr.\\r\\nLanier took for the second part of his title, but did not, I think,\\r\\nhandle very satisfactorily in his text.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I may perhaps add, without impropriety, that the composition of this\\r\\nbook has not been hurried, and that I have taken all the pains I could,\\r\\nby revision and addition as it proceeded, to make it a complete survey\\r\\nof the Novel, as it has come from the hands of all the more important\\r\\nnovelists, not now alive, up to the end of the nineteenth century.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>GEORGE SAINTSBURY.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Christmas</i>, 1912.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>CONTENTS</h3><br />\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- Autogenerated TOC.

It might be an\\r\\naccident, though a rather improbable one, that we have no Greek prose\\r\\nfiction till a time long subsequent to the Christian era, and nothing in\\r\\nLatin at all except the fragments of Petronius and the romance of\\r\\nApuleius. But it can be no accident, and it is a very momentous fact,\\r\\nthat, from the foundation of Greek criticism, &quot;Imitation,&quot; that is to\\r\\nsay &quot;Fiction&quot; (for it is neither more nor less), was regarded as not\\r\\nmerely the inseparable but the constituent property of poetry, even\\r\\nthough those who held this were doubtful whether poetry must necessarily\\r\\nbe in verse. It is another fact of the greatest importance that the\\r\\nancients who, in other forms than deliberate prose fiction, try to &quot;tell\\r\\na story,&quot; do not seem to know very well how to do it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The <i>Odyssey</i> is, indeed, one of the greatest of all stories, it is the\\r\\noriginal romance of the West; but the <i>Iliad</i>, though a magnificent\\r\\npoem, is not much of a story. Herodotus can tell one, if anybody can,\\r\\nand Plato (or<a name=\"Page_2\" id=\"Page_2\" /> Socrates) evidently could have done so if it had lain in\\r\\nhis way: while the <i>Anabasis</i>, though hardly the <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i>, shows\\r\\nglimmerings in Xenophon. But otherwise we must come down to Lucian and\\r\\nthe East before we find the faculty. So, too, in Latin before the two\\r\\nlate writers named above, Ovid is about the only person who is a real\\r\\nstory-teller. Virgil makes very little of his <i>story</i> in verse: and it\\r\\nis shocking to think how Livy throws away his chances in prose. No:\\r\\nputting the Petronian fragments aside, Lucian and Apuleius are the only\\r\\ntwo novelists in the classical languages before about 400 A.D.: and\\r\\nputting aside their odd coincidence of subject, it has to be remembered\\r\\nthat Lucian was a Syrian Greek and Apuleius an African Latin. The\\r\\nconquered world was to conquer not only its conqueror, but its\\r\\nconqueror\\'s teacher, in this youngest accomplishment of literary art.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It was probably in all cases, if not certainly, mixed blood that\\r\\nproduced the curious development generally called Greek Romance. It is\\r\\nno part of our business to survey, in any detail, the not very numerous\\r\\nbut distinctly interesting compositions which range in point of\\r\\nauthorship from Longus and Heliodorus, probably at the meeting of the\\r\\nfourth and fifth centuries, to Eustathius in the twelfth. At one time\\r\\nindeed, when we may return to them a little, we shall find them\\r\\nexercising direct and powerful influence on modern European fiction, and\\r\\nso both directly and indirectly on English: but that is a time a good\\r\\nway removed from the actual beginning of our journey. Still, <i>Apollonius\\r\\nof Tyre</i>, which is probably the oldest piece of English prose fiction\\r\\nthat we have, is beyond all doubt derived ultimately from a Greek\\r\\noriginal of this very class: and the class itself is an immense advance,\\r\\nin the novel direction, upon anything that we have before. It is on <a name=\"Page_3\" id=\"Page_3\" />the\\r\\none hand essentially a &quot;romance of adventure,&quot; and on the other\\r\\nessentially a &quot;love-story&quot;&mdash;in senses to which we find little in\\r\\nclassical literature to correspond in the one case and still less in the\\r\\nother. Instead of being, like <i>Lucius</i> and the <i>Golden Ass</i>, a tissue of\\r\\nstories essentially unconnected and little more than framed by the main\\r\\ntale, it is, though it may have a few episodes, an example of at least\\r\\nromantic unity throughout, with definite hero and definite heroine, the\\r\\nprominence and importance of the latter being specially noteworthy. It\\r\\nis in fact the first division of literature in which the heroine assumes\\r\\nthe position of a protagonist. If it falls short in character, so do\\r\\neven later romances to a great extent: if dialogue is not very\\r\\naccomplished, that also was hardly to be thoroughly developed till the\\r\\nnovel proper came into being. In the other two great divisions, incident\\r\\nand description, it is abundantly furnished. And, above all, the two\\r\\ngreat Romantic motives, Adventure and Love, are quite maturely present\\r\\nin it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To pass to the deluge, and beyond it, and to come to close quarters with\\r\\nour proper division, the origin of Romance itself is a very debatable\\r\\nsubject, or rather it is a subject which the wiser mind will hardly care\\r\\nto debate much. The opinion of the present writer&mdash;the result, at least,\\r\\nof many years\\' reading and thought&mdash;is that it is a result of the\\r\\nmarriage of the older East and the newer (non-classical) West through\\r\\nthe agency of the spread of Christianity and the growth and diffusion of\\r\\nthe &quot;Saint\\'s Life.&quot; The beginnings of Hagiology itself are very\\r\\nuncertain: but what is certain is that they are very early: and that as\\r\\nthe amalgamation or leavening of the Roman world with barbarian material\\r\\nproceeded, the spread of Christianity proceeded likewise. The <i>Vision of\\r\\nSt. Paul</i>&mdash;one of the <a name=\"Page_4\" id=\"Page_4\" />earliest examples and the starter it would seem,\\r\\nif not of the whole class of sacred Romances, at any rate of the large\\r\\nsubsection devoted to Things after Death&mdash;has been put as early as\\r\\n&quot;before 400 A.D.&quot; It would probably be difficult to date such legends as\\r\\nthose of St. Margaret and St. Catherine <i>too</i> early, having regard to\\r\\ntheir intrinsic indications: and the vast cycle of Our Lady, though\\r\\nprobably later, must have begun long before the modern languages were\\r\\nready for it, while that of the Cross should be earlier still. And let\\r\\nit be remembered that these Saints\\' Lives, which are still infinitely\\r\\ngood reading, are not in the least confined to homiletic necessities.\\r\\nThe jejuneness and woodenness from which the modern religious story too\\r\\noften suffers are in no way chargeable upon all, or even many, of them.\\r\\nThey have the widest range of incident&mdash;natural as well as supernatural:\\r\\ntheir touches of nature are indeed extended far beyond mere incident.\\r\\nPurely comic episodes are by no means wanting: and these, like the\\r\\nparallel passages in the dramatising of these very legends, were sure to\\r\\nlead to isolation of them, and to a secular continuation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But, once more, we must contract the sweep, and quicken the pace to deal\\r\\nnot with possible origins, but with actual results&mdash;not with Ancient or\\r\\nTransition literature, but with the literature of English in the\\r\\ndepartment first of fiction generally and then, with a third and last\\r\\nnarrowing, to the main subject of English fiction in prose.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The very small surviving amount, and the almost completely second-hand\\r\\ncharacter, of Anglo-Saxon literature have combined to frustrate what\\r\\nmight have been expected from another characteristic of it&mdash;the unusual\\r\\nequality of its verse and prose departments. We have only one&mdash;not<a name=\"Page_5\" id=\"Page_5\" />\\r\\nquite entire but substantive&mdash;prose tale in Anglo-Saxon, the version of\\r\\nthe famous story of <i>Apollonius of Tyre</i>, which was to be afterwards\\r\\ndeclined by Chaucer, but attempted by his friend and contemporary Gower,\\r\\nand to be enshrined in the most certain of the Shakespearean\\r\\n&quot;doubtfuls,&quot; <i>Pericles</i>. It most honestly gives itself out as a\\r\\ntranslation (no doubt from the Latin though there was an early Greek\\r\\noriginal) and it deals briefly with the subject. But as an example of\\r\\nnarrative style it is very far indeed from being contemptible: and in\\r\\npassages such as Apollonius\\' escape from shipwreck, and his wooing of\\r\\nthe daughter of Arcestrates, there is something which is different from\\r\\nstyle, and with which style is not always found in company&mdash;that faculty\\r\\nof telling a story which has been already referred to. Nor does this\\r\\nfail in the narrative portions of the prose Saints\\' Lives and Homilies,\\r\\nespecially Aelfric\\'s, which we possess; in fact it is in these last\\r\\ndistinctly remarkable&mdash;as where Aelfric tells the tale of the monk who\\r\\nspied on St. Cuthbert\\'s seaside devotions. The same faculty is\\r\\nobservable in Latin work, not least in Bede\\'s still more famous telling\\r\\nof the Caedmon story, and of the vision of the other world.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But these faculties have better chance of exhibiting themselves in the\\r\\nverse division of our Anglo-Saxon wreckage. <i>Beowulf</i> itself consists of\\r\\none first-rate story and one second-rate but not despicable tale,\\r\\nhitched together more or less anyhow. The second, with good points, is,\\r\\nfor us, negligible: the first is a &quot;yarn&quot; of the primest character. One\\r\\nmay look back to the <i>Odyssey</i> itself without finding anything so good,\\r\\nexcept the adventures of the Golden Ass which had all the story-work of\\r\\ntwo mightiest literatures behind them. As literature on the other hand,\\r\\n<i>Beowulf</i> may be overpraised: it has been <a name=\"Page_6\" id=\"Page_6\" />so frequently. But let\\r\\nanybody with the slightest faculty of &quot;conveyance&quot; tell the first part\\r\\nof the story to a tolerably receptive audience, and he will not doubt\\r\\n(unless he is fool enough to set the effect down to his own gifts and\\r\\ngraces) about its excellence as such. There is character&mdash;not much, but\\r\\nenough to make it more than a <i>mere</i> story of adventure&mdash;and adventure\\r\\nenough for anything; there is by no means ineffectual speech&mdash;even\\r\\ndialogue&mdash;of a kind: and there is some effective and picturesque\\r\\ndescription. The same faculties reappear in such mere fragments as that\\r\\nof <i>Waldhere</i> and the &quot;Finnsburgh&quot; fight: but they are shown much more\\r\\nfully in the Saints\\' Lives&mdash;best of all in the <i>Andreas</i>, no doubt, but\\r\\nremarkably also (especially considering the slender amount of\\r\\n&quot;happenings&quot;) in the <i>Guthlac</i> and the <i>Juliana</i>. In fact the very\\r\\nfragments of Anglo-Saxon poetry, by a sort of approximation which they\\r\\nshow to dramatic narrative and which with a few exceptions is far less\\r\\npresent in the classics, foretell much more clearly and certainly than\\r\\nin the case of some other foretellings which have been detected in them,\\r\\nthe future achievements of English literature in the department of\\r\\nfiction. <i>The Ruin</i> (the finest thing perhaps in all Anglo-Saxon) is a\\r\\nsort of background study for something that might have been much better\\r\\nthan <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>: and <i>The Complaint of Deor</i>, in its\\r\\nallusion to the adventures of the smith Weland and others, makes one\\r\\nsorry that some one more like the historian of a later and decadent\\r\\nthough agreeable Wayland the Smith, had not told us the tale that is now\\r\\nleft untold. A crowd of fantastic imaginings or additions, to supply the\\r\\nmain substance, and a certain common-sense grasp of actual conditions\\r\\nand circumstances to set them upon, and contrast them with&mdash;these are\\r\\nthe great requirements of Fiction in life and <a name=\"Page_7\" id=\"Page_7\" />character. You must mix\\r\\nprose and poetry to get a good romance or even novel. The consciences of\\r\\nthe ancients revolted from this mixture of kinds; but there was no such\\r\\nrevolt in the earlier moderns, and least of all in our own medi&aelig;val\\r\\nforefathers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So few people are really acquainted with the whole range of Romance\\r\\n(even in English), or with any large part of it, that one may without\\r\\nundue presumption set down in part, if not in whole, to ignorance, a\\r\\ndoctrine and position which we must now attack. This is that romance and\\r\\nnovel are widely separated from each other; and that the historian of\\r\\nthe novel is really straying out of his ground if he meddles with\\r\\nRomance. These are they who would make our proper subject begin with\\r\\nMarivaux and Richardson, or at earliest with Madame de La Fayette, who\\r\\nexclude Bunyan altogether, and sometimes go so far as to question the\\r\\nright of entry to Defoe. But the counter-arguments are numerous: and any\\r\\none of them would almost suffice by itself. In the first place the idea\\r\\nof the novel arising so late is unnatural and unhistorical: these\\r\\nMelchisedecs without father or mother are not known in literature. In\\r\\nthe second a pedantic insistence on the exclusive definition of the\\r\\nnovel involves one practical inconvenience which no one, even among\\r\\nthose who believe in it, has yet dared to face. You must carry your wall\\r\\nof partition along the road as well as across it: and write separate\\r\\nhistories of Novel and Romance for the last two centuries. The present\\r\\nwriter can only say that, though he has dared some tough adventures in\\r\\nliterary history, he would altogether decline this. Without the help of\\r\\nthe ants that succoured Psyche against Venus that heap would indeed be\\r\\nill to sort.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But there is a third argument, less practical in appearance <a name=\"Page_8\" id=\"Page_8\" />but bolder\\r\\nand deeper, which is really decisive of the matter, though few seem to\\r\\nhave seen it or at least taken it up. The separation of romance and\\r\\nnovel&mdash;of the story of incident and the story of character and\\r\\nmotive&mdash;is a mistake logically and psychologically. It is a very old\\r\\nmistake, and it has deceived some of the elect: but a mistake it is. It\\r\\nmade even Dr. Johnson think Fielding shallower than Richardson; and it\\r\\nhas made people very different from Dr. Johnson think that Count Tolstoi\\r\\nis a greater analyst and master of a more developed humanity than\\r\\nFielding. As a matter of fact, when you have excogitated two or more\\r\\nhuman beings out of your own head and have set them to work in the\\r\\nnarrative (not the dramatic) way, you have made the novel <i>in posse</i>, if\\r\\nnot <i>in esse</i>, from its apparently simplest development, such as\\r\\n<i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, to its apparently most complex, such as the\\r\\n<i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> or the triumphs of Mr. Meredith. You have started the\\r\\n&quot;Imitation&quot;&mdash;the &quot;fiction&quot;&mdash;and <i>tout est l&agrave;</i>. The ancients could do\\r\\nthis in the dramatic way admirably, though on few patterns; in the\\r\\npoetical way as admirably, but again not on many. The Middle Ages lost\\r\\nthe dramatic way almost entirely, but they actually improved the\\r\\npoetical on its narrative side, and the result was Romance. In every\\r\\nromance there is the germ of a novel and more; there is at least the\\r\\nsuggestion and possibility of romance in every novel that deserves the\\r\\nname. In the Tristram story and the Lancelot cycle there are most of the\\r\\nthings that the romancer of incident and the novelist of character and\\r\\nmotive can want or can use, till the end of the world; and Malory (that\\r\\n&quot;mere compiler&quot; as some pleasantly call him) has put the possibilities\\r\\nof the latter and greater creation so that no one who has eyes can miss\\r\\nthem. Nor <i>in the beginning</i> does it much <a name=\"Page_9\" id=\"Page_9\" />or at all matter whether the\\r\\nvehicle was prose or verse. In fact they mostly wrote in verse because\\r\\nprose was not ready.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the minor romances and tales (taking English versions only) from\\r\\n<i>Havelok</i> to <i>Beryn</i> there is a whole universe of situation, scenario,\\r\\nopportunity for &quot;business.&quot; That they have the dress and the\\r\\nscene-backing of one particular period can matter to no one who has eyes\\r\\nfor anything beyond dress and scene-backing. And when we are told that\\r\\nthey are apt to run too much into grooves and families, it is sufficient\\r\\nto answer that it really does not lie in the mouth of an age which\\r\\nproduces grime-novels, problem-novels, and so forth, as if they had been\\r\\nstruck off on a hectograph, possessing the not very exalted gift of\\r\\nvarying names and places&mdash;to reproach any other age on this score. But\\r\\nwe have only limited room here for generalities and still less for\\r\\ncontroversy; let us turn to our proper work and survey the actual\\r\\nturn-out in fiction&mdash;mostly as a result of mere fashion, verse, but\\r\\npartly prose&mdash;which the Middle Ages has left us as a contribution to\\r\\nthis department of English literature.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It has been said that few people know the treasures of English romance,\\r\\nyet there is little excuse for ignorance of them. It is some century\\r\\nsince Ellis\\'s extremely amusing, if sometimes rather prosaic, book put\\r\\nmuch of the matter before those who will not read originals; to be\\r\\nfollowed in the same path by Dunlop later, and much later still by the\\r\\ninvaluable and delightful <i>Catalogue of</i> [British Museum] <i>Romances</i> by\\r\\nMr. Ward. It is nearly as long since the collections of Ritson and\\r\\nWeber, soon supplemented by others, and enlarged for the last forty\\r\\nyears by the publications of the Early English Text Society, put these\\r\\noriginals themselves within the reach of everybody who is not so <a name=\"Page_10\" id=\"Page_10\" />lazy\\r\\nor so timid as to be disgusted or daunted by a very few actually\\r\\nobsolete words and a rather large proportion of obsolete spellings,\\r\\nwhich will yield to even the minimum of intelligent attention. Only a\\r\\nvery small number (not perhaps including a single one of importance)\\r\\nremain unprinted, though no doubt a few are out of print or difficult to\\r\\nobtain. The quality and variety of the stories told in them are both\\r\\nvery considerable, even without making allowance for what has been\\r\\ncalled the stock character of medi&aelig;val composition. That almost all are\\r\\ndirectly imitated from the French is probable enough, that most are is\\r\\ncertain: but this matters, for our purpose, nothing at all. That the\\r\\nimitation was not haphazard or indiscriminate is obvious. Thus, though\\r\\nwe have some, we have not very many representatives of the class which\\r\\nwas the most numerous of all in France&mdash;the <i>chansons de geste</i> or\\r\\nstories of French legendary history, national or family. Except as far\\r\\nas the Saracens are concerned, they would naturally have less interest\\r\\nfor English hearers. The <i>Mati&egrave;re de Rome</i>, again&mdash;the legends of\\r\\nantiquity&mdash;though represented, is not very abundant outside of the\\r\\nuniversally popular Tale of Troy; and the almost equally popular\\r\\nAlexander legend does not occupy a very large part of them. What is\\r\\nperhaps more remarkable is that until Malory exercised his genius upon\\r\\n&quot;the French book,&quot; the more poetical parts of the &quot;matter of Britain&quot;\\r\\nitself do not seem to have been very much written about in English. The\\r\\npreliminary stuff about Merlin and Vortigern exists in several\\r\\nhandlings; the foreign campaigns of Arthur seem always (perhaps from\\r\\nnational vanity) to have been popular. The &quot;off&quot;-branches of Tristram\\r\\nand Percivale, and not a few of the still more episodic romances of\\r\\nadventures concerning Gawain, Iwain, and other knights, receive\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_11\" id=\"Page_11\" />attention. The execrable Lonelich or Lovelich, who preceded Malory a\\r\\nlittle, had of course predecessors in handling the other parts of the\\r\\nGraal story. But the crown and flower of the whole&mdash;the inspiration\\r\\nwhich connected the Round Table and the Graal and the love of Lancelot\\r\\nand Guinevere&mdash;though, so far as the present writer\\'s reading and\\r\\nopinion are of any weight, the recent attempts to deprive the\\r\\nEnglishman, Walter Map, of the honour of conceiving it are of no\\r\\nforce&mdash;seems to have waited till the fifteenth century&mdash;that is to say\\r\\nthe last part of three hundred years&mdash;before Englishmen took it up. Most\\r\\npopular of all perhaps, on the principle that in novels the flock &quot;likes\\r\\nthe savour of fresh grass,&quot; seem to have been the pure <i>romans\\r\\nd\\'aventures</i>&mdash;quite unconnected or nearly so with each other or with any\\r\\nof the larger cycles. Those adventures of particular heroes have\\r\\nsometimes a sort of Arthurian link, but they really have no more to do\\r\\nwith the main Arthurian story than if Arthur were not.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the present purpose, however, filiation, origin, and such-like\\r\\nthings are of much less importance than the actual stories that get\\r\\nthemselves told to satisfy that demand which in due time is to produce\\r\\nthe supply of the novel. Of these the two oldest, as regards the actual\\r\\nforms in which we have them, are capital examples of the more and less\\r\\noriginal handling of &quot;common-form&quot; stories or motives. They were not\\r\\nthen, be it remembered, quite such common-form as now&mdash;the rightful heir\\r\\nkept out of his rights, the usurper of them, the princess gracious or\\r\\nscornful or both by turns, the quest, the adventure, the revolutions and\\r\\ndiscoveries and fights, the wedding bells and the poetical justice on\\r\\nthe villain. Let it be remembered, too, if anybody is scornful of these\\r\\nas <i>vieux jeu</i>, that they have never been really improved upon except by\\r\\nthe <a name=\"Page_12\" id=\"Page_12\" />very obvious and unoriginal method common in clever-silly days, of\\r\\nsimply reversing some of them, of &quot;turning platitudes topsy-turvy,&quot; as\\r\\nnot the least gifted, or most old-fashioned, of novelists, Tourguenief,\\r\\nhas it. Perhaps the oldest of all, <i>Havelok the Dane</i>&mdash;a story the age\\r\\nof which from evidence both internal and external, is so great that\\r\\npeople have not quite gratuitously imagined a still older Danish or even\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon original for the French romance from which our existing one\\r\\nis undoubtedly taken&mdash;is one of the most spirited of all. Both hero and\\r\\nheroine&mdash;Havelok, who should be King of Denmark and Goldborough, who\\r\\nshould be Queen of England&mdash;are ousted by their treacherous\\r\\nguardian-viceroys as infants; and Havelok is doomed to drowning by his\\r\\ntutor, the greater or at least bolder villain of the two. But the\\r\\nfisherman Grim, who is chosen as his murderer, discovers that the child\\r\\nhas, at night, a <i>nimbus</i> of flame round his head; renounces his crime\\r\\nand escapes by sea with the child and his own family to Grimsby.\\r\\nHavelok, growing up undistinguished from his foster-brethren, takes\\r\\nservice as a scullion with the English usurper. This usurper is seeking\\r\\nhow to rid himself of the princess without violence, but in some way\\r\\nthat will make her succession to the crown impossible, and Havelok\\r\\nhaving shown prowess in sports is selected as the maiden\\'s husband. She,\\r\\ntoo, discovers his royalty at night by the same token; and the pair\\r\\nregain their respective inheritances and take vengeance on their\\r\\nrespective traitors, in a lively and adventurous fashion. There are all\\r\\nthe elements of a good story in this: and they are by no means wasted or\\r\\nspoilt in the actual handling. It is not a mere sequence of incident;\\r\\nfrom the mixture of generosity and canniness in the fisherman who\\r\\nascertains that he is to have traitor\\'s wages before he finally decides\\r\\nto rescue<a name=\"Page_13\" id=\"Page_13\" /> Havelok, to the not unnatural repugnance of Goldborough at\\r\\nher forced wedding with a scullion, the points where character comes in\\r\\nare not neglected, though of course the author does not avail himself of\\r\\nthem either in Shakespearean or in Richardsonian fashion. They are\\r\\n<i>there</i>, ready for development by any person who may take it into his\\r\\nhead to develop them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So too is it in the less powerful and rather more cut and dried <i>King\\r\\nHorn</i>. Here the opening is not so very different; the hero\\'s father is\\r\\nmurdered by pirate invaders, and he himself set adrift in a boat. But in\\r\\nthis the princess (daughter of course of the king who shelters him)\\r\\nherself falls in love with Horn, and there is even a scene of\\r\\nconsiderable comic capabilities in which she confides this affection by\\r\\nmistake to one of his companions (fortunately a faithful one) instead of\\r\\nto himself. But Horn has a faithless friend also; and rivals, and\\r\\nadventures, and journeys; and returns just in the nick of time, and\\r\\nrecognitions by rings, and everything that can properly be desired\\r\\noccur. In these&mdash;even more perhaps than in Havelok\\'s more masculine and\\r\\nless sentimental fortunes&mdash;there are openings not entirely neglected by\\r\\nthe romancer (though, as has been said, he does not seem to have been\\r\\none of the strongest of his kind) for digression, expatiation,\\r\\nembroidery. Transpose these two stories (as the slow kind years will\\r\\nteach novelists inevitably to do) into slightly different keys,\\r\\nintroduce variations and episodes and <i>codas</i>, and you have the\\r\\npossibilities of a whole library of fiction, as big and as varied as any\\r\\nthat has ever established itself for subscribers, and bigger than any\\r\\nthat has ever offered itself as one collection to buyers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The love-stories of these two tales are what it is the fashion&mdash;exceedingly\\r\\ncomplimentary to the age referred <a name=\"Page_14\" id=\"Page_14\" />to if not to the age of the fashion\\r\\nitself&mdash;to call &quot;mid-Victorian&quot; in their complete &quot;propriety.&quot;\\r\\nIndeed, it is a Puritan lie, though it seems to possess the vivaciousness\\r\\nof its class, that the romances are distinguished by &quot;bold bawdry.&quot;\\r\\nThey are on the contrary rather singularly pure, and contrast, in\\r\\nthat respect, remarkably with the more popular folk-tale. But fiction,\\r\\nno more than drama, could do without the &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#7985;&#945;&mdash;the\\r\\nhuman and not unpardonable frailty. This appears in, and complicates,\\r\\nthe famous story of <i>Tristram</i>, which, though its present English form\\r\\nis probably younger than <i>Havelok</i> and <i>Horn</i>, is likely to have existed\\r\\nearlier: indeed must have done so if Thomas of Erceldoune wrote on the\\r\\nsubject. Few can require to be told that beautiful and tragical history\\r\\nof &quot;inauspicious stars&quot; which hardly any man, of the many who have\\r\\nhandled it in prose and verse, has been able to spoil. Our Middle\\r\\nEnglish form is not consummate, and is in some places crude in manner\\r\\nand in sentiment. But it is notable that the exaggerated and inartistic\\r\\nrepulsiveness of Mark, resorted to by later writers as a rather\\r\\nrudimentary means of exciting compassion for the lovers, is not to be\\r\\nfound here; in fact, one of the most poetical touches in the piece is\\r\\none of sympathy for the luckless husband, when he sees the face of his\\r\\nfaithless queen slumbering by her lover\\'s side with the sun on it. &quot;And\\r\\nMark rewed therefore.&quot; The story, especially in its completion with the\\r\\n&quot;Iseult of Brittany&quot; part and the death of Tristram, gives scope for\\r\\nevery possible faculty and craftsmanship of the most analytic as of the\\r\\nmost picturesque novelist of modern times. There is nothing in the least\\r\\nlike it in ancient literature; and to get a single writer who would do\\r\\nit justice in modern times we should have to take the best notes of\\r\\nCharles Kingsley, and Mr. Blackmore, and<a name=\"Page_15\" id=\"Page_15\" /> Mr. Meredith, leaving out all\\r\\ntheir faults, and combine. It is not surprising that, in the very\\r\\ninfancy of the art, nobody in German or French, any more than in English\\r\\n(though the German here is, as it happens, the best), should have done\\r\\nit full justice; but it is a wonder that a story of such capacities\\r\\nshould have been sketched, and even worked out in considerable detail,\\r\\nso early.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of the far greater story of which <i>Tristram</i> is a mere episode and\\r\\nhardly even that&mdash;a chantry or out-lying chapel of the great\\r\\ncathedral&mdash;the Arthurian Legend, the earlier English versions, or rather\\r\\nthe earlier versions in English, are, as has been said, not only\\r\\nfragmentary but disappointing. There is nothing in the least strange in\\r\\nthis, even though (as the present writer, who can speak with indifferent\\r\\nknowledge, still firmly holds) the conception of the story itself in its\\r\\ngreatest and unifying stage is probably if not certainly English. The\\r\\noriginal sources of the story of Arthur are no doubt Celtic; they give\\r\\nthemselves out as being so, and there is absolutely no critical reason\\r\\nfor disbelieving them. But in these earlier forms&mdash;the authority of the\\r\\nmost learned Celticists who have any literary gift and any appreciation\\r\\nof evidence is decisive on this point&mdash;not only are the most\\r\\ncharacteristic unifying features&mdash;the Graal story and the love of\\r\\nLancelot and Guinevere&mdash;completely wanting, but <i>the</i> great stroke of\\r\\ngenius&mdash;the connection of these two and the subordination of all minor\\r\\nlegends as to the dim national hero, Arthur, with those about him&mdash;is\\r\\nmore conspicuously wanting still. Whether it was the Englishman Walter\\r\\nMap, the Norman Robert de Borron, or the Frenchman Chrestien de Troyes,\\r\\nto whom this flash of illumination came, has never been proved&mdash;will\\r\\npretty certainly now never be proved. M. Gaston Paris failed to do it;\\r\\nand it is exceedingly unlikely <a name=\"Page_16\" id=\"Page_16\" />that, where he failed, any one else will\\r\\nsucceed, unless the thrice and thirty times sifted libraries of Europe\\r\\nyield some quite unexpected windfall. In the works commonly attributed\\r\\nto Chrestien, all of which are well known to the present writer, there\\r\\nis no sign of his having been able to conceive this, though he is a\\r\\ndelightful romancer. Robert is a mere shadow; and his attributed works,\\r\\n<i>as</i> his works, are shadows too, though they are interesting enough in\\r\\nthemselves. Walter not only has the greatest amount of traditional\\r\\nattribution, but is the undoubted author of <i>De Nugis Curialium</i>. And\\r\\nthe author of <i>De Nugis Curialium</i>, different as it is from the\\r\\nArthurian story, <i>could</i> have finally divined the latter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But at the time when he wrote, Englishmen, with the rarest exceptions,\\r\\nwrote only in French or Latin; and when they began to write in English,\\r\\na man of genius, to interpret and improve on him, was not found for a\\r\\nlong time. And the most interesting parts of the Arthurian story are\\r\\nrarely handled at all in such early vernacular versions of it as we\\r\\nhave, whether in verse or prose. Naturally enough, perhaps, it was the\\r\\nfabulous historic connection with British history, and the story of the\\r\\ngreat British enchanter Merlin, that attracted most attention. The\\r\\n<i>Arthour and Merlin</i> which is in the Auchinleck MS.; the prose <i>Merlin</i>,\\r\\npublished by the Early English Text Society; the alliterative Thornton\\r\\n<i>Morte d\\'Arthur</i>, and others, are wont to busy themselves about the\\r\\nantecedents of the real story&mdash;about the uninteresting wars of the King\\r\\nhimself with Saxons, and Romans, and giants, and rival kings, rather\\r\\nthan with the great chivalric triple cord of Round Table, Graal, and\\r\\nGuinevere\\'s fault. The pure Graal poems, <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>, the work\\r\\nof the abominable Lonelich or Lovelich, etc., deal mainly with another\\r\\nbranch of <a name=\"Page_17\" id=\"Page_17\" />previous questions&mdash;things bearable as introductions,\\r\\nfillings-up, and so forth, but rather jejune in themselves. The Scots\\r\\n<i>Lancelot</i> is later than Malory himself, and of very little interest.\\r\\nLayamon\\'s account, the oldest that we have, adds little (though what\\r\\nlittle it does add is not unimportant) to Geoffrey of Monmouth and Wace;\\r\\nand tells what it has to tell with nearly as little skill in narrative\\r\\nas in poetry. Only the metrical <i>Morte</i>&mdash;from which, it would appear,\\r\\nMalory actually transprosed some of his most effective passages in the\\r\\nmanner in which genius transproses or transverses&mdash;has, for that reason,\\r\\nfor its dealings with the catastrophe, and for the further opportunity\\r\\nof comparison with Tennyson, interest of the higher kind. But before we\\r\\ncome to Malory himself it is desirable to turn to the branches&mdash;the\\r\\nchapels, as we have called them, to the cathedral&mdash;which he also, in\\r\\nsome cases at least, utilised in the <i>magnum opus</i> of English prose\\r\\nromance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These outliers were rather more fortunate, probably for no more\\r\\nrecondite reason than that the French originals (from which they were in\\r\\nalmost every instance certainly taken) were finished in themselves. Of\\r\\nthe special Gawain cycle or sub-cycle we have two romances in pure\\r\\nmetrical form, and more than two in alliterative, which are above the\\r\\naverage in interest. <i>Ywain and Gawain</i>, one of the former, is derived\\r\\ndirectly or indirectly from the <i>Chevalier au Lyon</i> of Chrestien de\\r\\nTroyes; and both present some remarkable affinities with the unknown\\r\\noriginal of the &quot;Sir Beaumains&quot; episode of Malory, and, through it, with\\r\\nTennyson\\'s <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>. The other, <i>Lybius Disconus (Le Beau\\r\\nD&eacute;connu)</i> is also concerned with that courteous nephew of Arthur who, in\\r\\nlater versions of the main story, is somewhat sacrificed to Lancelot.\\r\\nFor a &quot;<i>real</i> romance,&quot; as it calls itself (though it is fair to say\\r\\nthat in the original the word <a name=\"Page_18\" id=\"Page_18\" />means &quot;royal&quot;), of the simpler kind but\\r\\nextremely well told, there are not many better metrical specimens than\\r\\n<i>Ywain and Gawain</i>, but it has less character-interest, actual or\\r\\npossible, than those which have been commented on. The hero, King\\r\\nUrien\\'s son, accepts an adventure in which another knight of the Table,\\r\\nSir Colgrevance, has fared ill, after it has been told in a conversation\\r\\nat court which is joined in first by the Queen and afterwards by the\\r\\nKing. Sir Kay here shows his usual cross-grainedness; and Guinevere\\r\\n&quot;with milde mood&quot; requests to know &quot;What the devil is thee within?&quot; The\\r\\nadventure is of a class well known in romance. You ride to a certain\\r\\nfountain, pour water from it on a stone, and then, after divers marvels,\\r\\nhave to do battle with a redoubtable knight. Colgrevance has fared\\r\\nbadly; Kay is as usual quite sure that he would fare better; but Ywain\\r\\nactually undertakes the task. He has a tough battle with the knight who\\r\\nanswers the challenge, but wounds him mortally; and when the knight\\r\\nflies to his neighbouring castle, is so hard on his heels that the\\r\\nportcullis actually drops on his horse\\'s haunches just behind the\\r\\nsaddle, and cuts the beast in two. Ywain is thus left between the\\r\\nportcullis and the (by this time shut) door&mdash;a position all the more\\r\\nawkward that the knight himself expires immediately after he has reached\\r\\nshelter. The situation is saved, however, by the guardian damsel of\\r\\nromance, Lunet (the Linet or Lynette of the Beaumains-Gareth story), who\\r\\nemerges from a postern between gate and portcullis and conveys the\\r\\nintruder safe to her own chamber. Here a magic bed makes him invisible:\\r\\nthough the whole castle, including the very room, is ransacked by the\\r\\ndead knight\\'s people and would-be revengers, at the bidding of his\\r\\nwidow.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This widow, however, is rather an Ephesian matron.<a name=\"Page_19\" id=\"Page_19\" /> The sagacious Lunet,\\r\\nwhose confidante she is, suggests to her that, unless she enlists some\\r\\ndoughty knight as her champion, the king will confiscate her fief; and\\r\\nthat there is no champion like a husband. A very little more finesse\\r\\neffects the marriage, even though the lady is made aware of the identity\\r\\nof her new lover and her own husband\\'s slayer. (It is of course\\r\\nnecessary to remember that the death of a combatant in fairly challenged\\r\\nand fought single contest was not reckoned as any fault to his\\r\\nantagonist.) Ywain actually shows his prowess against the King: and has\\r\\nan opportunity of showing Kay once more that it is one thing to blame\\r\\nother people for failing, and another to succeed yourself. And after\\r\\nthis the newly married pair live together happily for a time. But it was\\r\\nreckoned a fault in a knight to take too prolonged a honeymoon: and\\r\\nYwain, after what the French call <i>adieux d&eacute;chirants</i>, obtains leave for\\r\\nthe usual &quot;twelvemonth and a day,&quot; at the expiration of which, on St.\\r\\nJohn\\'s Eve, he is without fail to return, the engagement being sealed by\\r\\nthe gift from his lady of a special ring. He forgets his promise of\\r\\ncourse: and at the stated time a damsel appears, sternly demands the\\r\\nring, and announces her lady\\'s decision to have nothing further to do\\r\\nwith him. There is in such cases only one thing for any true knight,\\r\\nfrom Sir Lancelot to Sir Amadis, to do: and that is to go mad, divest\\r\\nhimself of his garments, and take to the greenwood. This Ywain duly\\r\\ndoes, supporting himself at first on the raw flesh of game which he\\r\\nkills with a bow and arrows wrested from a chance-comer; and then on\\r\\nless savage but still simple food supplied by a benevolent hermit. As he\\r\\nlies asleep under a tree, a lady rides by with attendants, and one of\\r\\nthese (another of the wise damsels of romance) recognises him as Sir\\r\\nYwain. The lady has at the time sore need of a <a name=\"Page_20\" id=\"Page_20\" />champion against a\\r\\nhostile earl, and she also fortunately possesses a box of ointment\\r\\ninfallible against madness, which Morgane la Faye has given her. With\\r\\nthis the damsel is sent back to anoint Ywain. He comes to his senses, is\\r\\narmed and clothed, undertakes the lady\\'s defence, and discomfits the\\r\\nearl: but is as miserable as ever. Resisting the lady\\'s offer of herself\\r\\nand all her possessions, he rides off once more &quot;with heavy heart and\\r\\ndreary cheer.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Soon he hears a hideous noise and, riding in its direction, finds that a\\r\\ndragon has attacked a lion. He succours the holier beast, kills the\\r\\ndragon, and though he has unavoidably wounded the lion in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> is\\r\\nthenceforth attended by him not merely as a food-provider, but as the\\r\\ndoughtiest of squires and comrades in fight. To aggravate his sorrow he\\r\\ncomes to the fountain and thorn-tree of the original adventure, and\\r\\nhears some one complaining in the chapel hard by. They exchange\\r\\nquestions. &quot;A man,&quot; he said, &quot;some time I was&quot; (which must be one of the\\r\\nearliest occurrences in English of a striking phrase), and the prisoner\\r\\nturns out to be Lunet. She has been accused of treason by the usual\\r\\nsteward (it is <i>very</i> hard for a steward of romance to be good) and two\\r\\nbrothers&mdash;of treason to her lady, and is to be burnt, unless she can\\r\\nfind a knight who will fight the three. Ywain agrees to defend her: but\\r\\nbefore he can carry out his promise he has, on the same morning, to meet\\r\\na terrible giant who is molesting his hosts at a castle where he is\\r\\nguested. Both adventures, however, are achieved on the same day, with\\r\\nvery notable aid from the lion: and Ywain undertakes a fresh one, being\\r\\nrecruited by the necessary damsel-messenger, against two half-fiend\\r\\nbrother knights. They stipulate that the lion is to be forcibly\\r\\nprevented from interfering, and he is locked up in <a name=\"Page_21\" id=\"Page_21\" />a room; but, hearing\\r\\nthe noise of battle, he scratches up the earth under the door, frees\\r\\nhimself, and once more succours his master at the nick of time. Even\\r\\nthis does not expiate Ywain\\'s fault: and yet another task falls to\\r\\nhim&mdash;the championship of the rights of the younger of a pair of sisters,\\r\\nthe elder of whom has secured no less a representative than Gawain\\r\\nhimself. The pair, unknowing and unknown, fight all day long before\\r\\nArthur\\'s court with no advantage on either side: and when the light\\r\\nfails an interchange of courtesies leads to recognition and the\\r\\nsettlement of the dispute. Now the tale is nearly full. Ywain rides yet\\r\\nagain to the magic fountain and performs the rite; there is no one to\\r\\nmeet him; the castle rocks and the inmates quake. But the crafty Lunet\\r\\npersuades her mistress to swear that if the Knight of the Lion, who has\\r\\nfallen at variance with his lady, will come to the rescue, she will do\\r\\nall she can to reconcile the pair. Which not ill-prepared &quot;curtain&quot; duly\\r\\nfalls: leaving us comfortably assured that Ywain and his Lady and Lunet\\r\\nand the Lion (one wishes that these two could have made a match of it,\\r\\nand he must surely have been a bewitched knight) lived happily</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\\r\\n<span>&quot;Until that death had driven them down.&quot;<br /></span>\\r\\n</div></div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This, it has been said, is a specimen of the pure romance; with little\\r\\nexcept incident in it, and a touch or two of manners. It does not, as\\r\\nthe others noticed above do, lend itself much to character-drawing. But\\r\\nit is spiritedly told; though rougher, it is much more vigorous than the\\r\\nFrench original; and the mere expletives and stock phrases, which are\\r\\nthe curse of these romances, do not obtrude themselves too much. In this\\r\\nrespect, and some others, it is the superior of the one coupled above\\r\\nwith it, <i>Lybius Disconus</i>, which is closer, except in names, to the\\r\\nBeaumains <a name=\"Page_22\" id=\"Page_22\" />story. Still, this also is not a bad specimen of the same\\r\\nclass. The hero of it is a son, not a brother, of Gawain, comes nameless\\r\\nor nicknamed, but as &quot;Beaufils,&quot; not &quot;Beaumains,&quot; to Arthur\\'s court, and\\r\\nis knighted at once, not made to go through the &quot;kitchen-knave&quot; stage.\\r\\nAccordingly, the damsel Elene (not Lunet), to whom he is assigned as\\r\\nchampion in the adventure of the Lady of Sinadowne, objects only to his\\r\\nnovelty of knighthood and is converted by his first victory. The course\\r\\nof the adventures is, however, different from that which some people\\r\\nknow from Malory, and many from Tennyson. One of them is farcical: the\\r\\nFair Unknown rescues a damsel at her utmost need from two giants, a red\\r\\nand a black, one of whom is roasting a wild boar and uses the animal as\\r\\na weapon, with the spit in it, for the combat. Moreover, he falls a\\r\\nvictim to the wiles of a sorceress-chatelaine whom he has also\\r\\nsuccoured: and it is only after the year and day that Elene goads him on\\r\\nto his proper quest. But this also is no bad story.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The limits of this volume admit of not much farther &quot;argument&quot; (though\\r\\nthe writer would very gladly give it) of these minor romances of\\r\\nadventure, Arthurian and other. Ellis\\'s easily accessible book supplies\\r\\nabstracts of the main Arthurian story before Malory; of the two most\\r\\nfamous, though by no means best, of all the non-Arthurian romances, <i>Guy\\r\\nof Warwick</i> and <i>Bevis of Hampton</i> (the former of which was handled and\\r\\nrehandled from age to age, moralised, curtailed, lengthened, and hashed\\r\\nup in every form); of the brilliant and vigorous <i>Richard\\r\\nCoeur-de-Lion</i>; of the less racy Charlemagne romances in English; of the\\r\\n<i>Seven Wise Masters</i>, brought from the East and naturalised all over\\r\\nEurope; of the delightful love story of <i>Florice and Blancheflour</i>; of\\r\\nthat powerful and pathetic <a name=\"Page_23\" id=\"Page_23\" />legend of the <i>Proud King</i> (Robert of\\r\\nSicily), which Longfellow and Mr. William Morris both modernised, each\\r\\nin his way; of those other legends, <i>Sir Isumbras</i> and <i>Amis and\\r\\nAmillion</i>, which are so beautiful to those who can appreciate the\\r\\nmedi&aelig;val mind, and to the beauty of which others seem insensible; of\\r\\n<i>Sir Triamond</i> and <i>Sir Eglamour</i> (examples of the romance at its\\r\\nweakest); of the exceedingly spirited and interesting <i>Ipomydon</i>, and of\\r\\nsome others, including the best of Scotch romances, <i>Sir Eger, Sir\\r\\nGrame, and Sir Graysteel</i>. But Ellis could not know others, and he left\\r\\nalone yet others that he might have known&mdash;the exquisite <i>Sir Launfal</i>\\r\\nof Thomas Chester at the beginning of the fifteenth century, where an\\r\\nunworthy presentment of Guinevere is compensated by the gracious image\\r\\nof Launfal\\'s fairy love; the lively adventures of <i>William of Palerne</i>,\\r\\nwho had a werewolf for his friend and an emperor\\'s daughter for his\\r\\nlove, eloping with her in white bear-skins, the unusual meat of which\\r\\nwas being cooked in her father\\'s kitchen; <i>Sir Orfeo</i>&mdash;Orpheus and\\r\\nEurydice, with a happy ending; <i>Emar&egrave;</i>, one of the tales of innocent but\\r\\npersecuted heroines of which Chaucer\\'s Constance is the best known;\\r\\n<i>Florence of Rome</i>; the rather famous <i>Squire of Low Degree; Sir\\r\\nAmadas</i>, not a very good handling of a fine motive, charity to a corpse;\\r\\nmany others.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nor does he seem to have known one of the finest of all&mdash;the\\r\\nalliterative romance of <i>Gawain and the Green Knight</i> which, since Dr.\\r\\nMorris published it some forty years ago for the Early English Text\\r\\nSociety, has made its way through text-books into more general knowledge\\r\\nthan most of its fellows enjoy. In this the hero is tempted repeatedly,\\r\\nelaborately, and with great knowledge of nature and no small command of\\r\\nart on the teller\\'s part, by the wife of his host and destined\\r\\nantagonist. He resists in the <a name=\"Page_24\" id=\"Page_24\" />main, but succumbs in the point of\\r\\naccepting a magic preservative as a gift: and is discovered and lectured\\r\\naccordingly. It is curious that this, which is far above the usual mere\\r\\nadventure-story and is novel of a high kind as well as romance, has no\\r\\nknown French original; and is strongly English in many characteristics\\r\\nbesides its verse-form.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the whole, however, one need have no difficulty in admitting that the\\r\\nmajority of these romances <i>do</i> somewhat content themselves with\\r\\nincident, incident only, and incident not merely of a na&iuml;f but of a\\r\\nstock kind, for their staple. There are striking situations, even striking\\r\\nphrases, here and there; there is plenty of variety in scene, and more than\\r\\nis sometimes thought in detail; but the motive-and-character-interest is\\r\\nrarely utilised as it might be, and very generally is not even suggested.\\r\\nThere is seldom any real plot or &quot;fable&quot;&mdash;only a chain of events: and\\r\\nthough no one but a very dull person will object to the supernatural\\r\\nelement, or to the exaggerated feats of professedly natural prowess and\\r\\nendurance, it cannot be said that on the whole they are artistically\\r\\nmanaged. You feel, not merely that the picture would have been better if\\r\\nthe painter had taken more pains, but that the reason why he did not\\r\\nis that he did not know how.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sir Thomas Malory, himself most unknown perhaps of all great writers,\\r\\ndid know how; and a cynical person might echo the <i>I nunc</i> of the Roman\\r\\nsatirist, and dwell on the futility of doing great things, in reference\\r\\nto the fact that it used to be fashionable, and is still not uncommon,\\r\\nto call Malory a &quot;mere compiler.&quot; Indeed from the direction which modern\\r\\nstudy so often takes, of putting inquiry into origins above everything,\\r\\nand neglecting the consideration of the work as work, this practice is\\r\\nnot <a name=\"Page_25\" id=\"Page_25\" />likely soon to cease. But no mistake about the mysterious\\r\\nEnglishman (the place-names with which the designation is connected are\\r\\nall pure English) is possible to any one who has read his book, and who\\r\\nknows what prose fiction is. <i>The Noble Histories of King Arthur, La\\r\\nMorte d\\'Arthur, The Story of the most Noble and Worthy King Arthur, The\\r\\nMost Ancient and Famous History of the Renowned Prince Arthur, The\\r\\nBirth, Life, and Acts of King Arthur</i>&mdash;call it by whichever name anybody\\r\\nlikes of those which various printers and reprinters have given it&mdash;is\\r\\none of the great books of the world. If they can give us any single\\r\\n&quot;French book&quot;&mdash;the reference to which is a commonplace of the\\r\\nsubject&mdash;from which it was taken, let them; they have not yet. If they\\r\\npoint out (as they can) French and English books from which parts of it\\r\\nwere taken, similar things may be done with Dante and Chaucer, with\\r\\nShakespeare and Milton, and very probably could have been done with\\r\\nHomer. It is what the artist does with his materials, not where he gets\\r\\nthem, that is the question. And Malory has done, with <i>his</i> materials, a\\r\\nvery great thing indeed. He is working no doubt to a certain extent\\r\\nblindly; working much better than he knows, and sometimes as he would\\r\\nnot work if he knew better; though whether he would work as well if he\\r\\nknew better is quite a different point. Sometimes he may not take the\\r\\nbest available version of a story; but we must ask ourselves whether he\\r\\nknew it. Sometimes he may put in what we do not want: but we must ask\\r\\nourselves whether there was not a reason for doing so, to him if not to\\r\\nus. What is certain is that he, and he only in any language, makes of\\r\\nthis vast assemblage of stories one story, and one book. He does it\\r\\n(much more than half unconsciously no doubt) by following the lines of,\\r\\nas I suppose, Walter Map, and <a name=\"Page_26\" id=\"Page_26\" />fusing the different motives, holding to\\r\\nthis method even in parts of the legend with which, so far as one knows,\\r\\nMap cannot have meddled. Before him this legend consisted of half a\\r\\ndozen great divisions&mdash;a word which may be used of malice prepense.\\r\\nThese were the story of Merlin, that of Arthur\\'s own origin, and that of\\r\\nthe previous history of the Graal for introduction; the story of\\r\\nArthur\\'s winning the throne, of the Round Table, and of the marriage\\r\\nwith Guinevere, also endless branchings of special knights\\' adventures,\\r\\nand of the wars with the Saxons and the Romans, and the episode of the\\r\\nFalse Guinevere&mdash;with whom for a time Arthur lives as with his\\r\\nqueen&mdash;for middle; and the story of the Graal-quest, the love of\\r\\nLancelot for the Queen, and the rebellion of Mordred with its fatal\\r\\nconsequences, for close. Exactly how much of this Malory personally had\\r\\nbefore him we cannot of course say: but of any working up of the whole\\r\\nthat would have spared him trouble, and robbed him of credit, we do not\\r\\nknow. In fact the favourite term &quot;compiler&quot; gives up the only dangerous\\r\\npoint. Now in what way did Malory <i>compile</i>? In the way in which the\\r\\nordinary compiler proceeds he most emphatically does not. He cuts down\\r\\nthe preliminaries mercilessly: but they can be perfectly well spared. He\\r\\nmisses almost all the wars with the Saxons, which are the most tedious\\r\\nparts of the originals. He adopts, most happily, the early, not the\\r\\nlate, placing of those with the Romans. He drops the false Guinevere\\r\\naltogether, which is imperative, that the true one may have no right to\\r\\nplead the incident&mdash;though he does not represent Arthur as &quot;blameless.&quot;\\r\\nHe gives the <i>roman d\\'aventures</i> side of the Round Table stories, from\\r\\nthe great Tristram and Palomides romances through the Beaumains episode\\r\\ndownwards, because they are interesting in themselves and lead <a name=\"Page_27\" id=\"Page_27\" />up to\\r\\nthe Graal quest. He gives that Quest as plentifully because it leads up\\r\\nto the &quot;dolorous death and departing out of this world of them all.&quot; How\\r\\nhe gives the Lancelot and Guinevere tragedy we shall see presently. And\\r\\nthe catastrophe of the actual &quot;departing&quot; he gives perfectly; with the\\r\\nmagnificent final scenes which he has converted, sometimes in almost\\r\\nShakespearean fashion, by the slightest verbal touches from mediocre\\r\\nverse to splendid prose. A very remarkable compiler! It is a pity that\\r\\nthey did not take him and cut him up in little stars for a light to all\\r\\nhis brethren in compiling thereafter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For he has what no compiler as such can have&mdash;because the moment he has\\r\\nit he ceases to be a compiler, and becomes an artist&mdash;the sense of\\r\\n<i>grasp</i>, the power to put his finger, and to keep it, on the central\\r\\npulse and nerve of the story. That he did this deliberately is so\\r\\nunlikely as to be practically impossible: that he did it is certain. The\\r\\nArthurian Legend is the greatest of medi&aelig;val creations as a subject&mdash;a\\r\\n&quot;fable&quot;&mdash;just as the <i>Divina Commedia</i> is the greatest of medi&aelig;val\\r\\n&quot;imitations&quot; and works of art. And as such it is inevitable that it\\r\\nshould carry with it the sense of the greatest medieval <i>differences</i>,\\r\\nChivalry and Romance. The strong point of these differences is the way\\r\\nin which they combine the three great motives, as Dante isolates them,\\r\\nof Valour, Love, and Religion. The ancients never realised this\\r\\ncombination at all; the moderns have merely struggled after it, or\\r\\nblasphemed it in fox-and-grapes fashion: the medi&aelig;vals <i>had</i> it&mdash;in\\r\\ntheory at any rate. The Round Table stories, merely as such, illustrate\\r\\nValour; the Graal stories, Religion; the passion of Lancelot and\\r\\nGuinevere with the minor instances, Love. All these have their\\r\\n&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#7985;&#945;&mdash;their tragic and tragedy-causing fault and flaw. The knight\\r\\nwastes his valour in idle bickerings; <a name=\"Page_28\" id=\"Page_28\" />he forgets law in his love; and\\r\\nthough there is no actual degradation of religion, he fails to live up\\r\\nto the ideal that he does not actually forswear. To throw the\\r\\npresentation&mdash;the <i>mimesis</i>&mdash;of all this into perfectly worthy form\\r\\nwould probably have been too much for any single genius of that curious\\r\\ntime (when genius was so widely spread and so little concentrated)\\r\\nexcept Dante himself, whose hand found other work to do. To colour and\\r\\nshape the various fragments of the mosaic was the work of scores. To put\\r\\nthem together, if not in absolutely perfect yet in more than sufficient\\r\\nshape, was, so far as we know, the luck of Malory only: though some one\\r\\n(Map or another) had done a mighty day\\'s work long before in creating\\r\\nthe figure and the adventures of Lancelot and imagining the later quest\\r\\nof the Graal with the figure of Galahad&mdash;that &quot;improved Percivale,&quot; as\\r\\nthe seedsmen say.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But besides this power of shaping (or even of merely combining)\\r\\nscattered elements into a story, Malory has another&mdash;<i>the</i> other of the\\r\\nfirst importance to the novelist proper&mdash;in his attraction to character,\\r\\nif not exactly in his making up of it. It has been said above that the\\r\\ndefect of the pure romances&mdash;especially those of continental origin&mdash;is\\r\\nthe absence of this. What the Greeks called &#948;&#953;&#7937;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&mdash;&quot;sentiment,&quot;\\r\\n&quot;thought,&quot; &quot;cast of thought,&quot; as it has been variously rendered&mdash;is even\\r\\nmore absent from them than plot or character itself: and of its almost\\r\\nnecessary connection with this latter they often seem to have no idea.\\r\\nVery rare is such a touch as that of Sir Amadas being unable at the feast\\r\\nto get rid of the memory of the unburied corpse, kept by enemies from the\\r\\nkindly earth that would hide it, and the rites that would help it to peace:\\r\\nstill rarer that in <i>Guy of Warwick</i> when the hero, at the height of\\r\\nhis fame and in the full enjoyment of his <a name=\"Page_29\" id=\"Page_29\" />desires, looks from the tower and\\r\\nis struck by the selfishness and earthliness of his career. The first\\r\\nnotion is not &quot;improved&quot; in the original at all, and the second very badly;\\r\\nbut in most of the others such things do not even exist. Now the greater\\r\\nLegend is full of situations which encourage such thoughts, and even of\\r\\nexpressed thoughts that only need craftsmanship to turn them into the\\r\\ncornerstones of character-building, and the jewels, five or fifty words\\r\\nlong, of literature. The fate and metaphysical aid that determine the\\r\\nrelations of Tristram and Iseult; the unconscious incest of Arthur and\\r\\nMargause with its Greek-tragic consequence; the unrewarded fidelity of\\r\\nPalomides, and (an early instance of the soon to be triumphant allegory)\\r\\nhis fruitless chase of the Beast Glatissant; all these are matters in\\r\\npoint. But of course the main nursery of such things is the\\r\\nLancelot-and-Guinevere story itself. Nobody has yet made Guinevere a\\r\\nperson&mdash;nobody but Shakespeare could have done so perhaps, though\\r\\nShakespeare\\'s Guinevere would probably have been the greatest woman in\\r\\nall art. But Malory has not been the least successful with her: and of\\r\\nLancelot he has made, if only in study, one of the great characters of\\r\\nthat fictitious world which is so much truer than the real. And let no\\r\\none say that we are reading Tennyson or any one else into Malory. There\\r\\nare yet persons, at least at the time this was written not quite\\r\\nMethusalahs, who read the <i>Morte d\\'Arthur</i> before the <i>Idylls</i> appeared\\r\\nand who have never allowed even the <i>Idylls</i> to overlay their original\\r\\nidea of the most perfect and most gentle of knights.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is probable indeed that Malory invented little or nothing in the\\r\\nvarious situations, by which the character of Lancelot, and the history\\r\\nof his fatal love, are evolved. We know in most cases that this is so.\\r\\nIt is possible, too, <a name=\"Page_30\" id=\"Page_30\" />that at first (probably because the possibilities\\r\\nhad not dawned on him, as it has been admitted they never did very\\r\\nconsciously) he has not made the most of the introduction of lover and\\r\\nlady. But when the interest becomes concentrated, as in the various\\r\\npassages of Guinevere\\'s wrath with her lover and their consequences, or\\r\\nin the final series of catastrophes, he is fully equal to the occasion.\\r\\nWe <i>know</i>&mdash;this time to his credit&mdash;how he has improved, in the act of\\r\\nborrowing them, the earlier verse-pictures of the final parting of the\\r\\nlovers, and there are many other episodes and juxtapositions of which as\\r\\nmuch may be said. That except as to Lancelot\\'s remorse (which after all\\r\\nis the great point) there is not much actual talk about motive and\\r\\nsentiment is nothing; or nothing but the condition of the time. The\\r\\nimportant point is that, as the electricians say, &quot;the house is wired&quot;\\r\\nfor the actual installation of character-novelling. There is here the\\r\\ncomplete scenario, and a good deal more, for a novel as long as\\r\\n<i>Clarissa</i> and much more interesting, capable of being worked out in the\\r\\nmanner, not merely of Richardson himself, but of Mr. Meredith or Mr.\\r\\nHardy. It <i>is</i> a great romance, if not the greatest of romances: it has\\r\\na great novel, if not the greatest of novels, written in sympathetic ink\\r\\nbetween the lines, and with more than a little of the writing sometimes\\r\\nemerging to view.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Little in the restricted space here available can be, though much might\\r\\nbe in a larger, said about the remaining attempts in English fiction\\r\\nbefore the middle of the sixteenth century. The later romances, down to\\r\\nthose of Lord Berners, show the character of the older with a certain\\r\\naddition of the &quot;conjuror\\'s supernatural&quot; of the <i>Amadis</i> school. But\\r\\nthe short verse-tales, especially those of the Robin Hood cycle, and\\r\\nsome of the purely comic kind, <a name=\"Page_31\" id=\"Page_31\" />introduce an important variation of\\r\\ninterest: and even some of the longer, such as that <i>Tale of Beryn</i>,\\r\\nwhich used to be included in Chaucer\\'s works, vary the chivalrous model\\r\\nin a useful way. Still more important is the influence of the short\\r\\n<i>prose</i> tale:&mdash;first Latin, as in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> (which of course\\r\\nhad older and positively medi&aelig;val forerunners), then Italian and French.\\r\\nThe prose saved the writer from verbiage and stock phrase; the shortness\\r\\nfrom the tendency to &quot;watering out&quot; which is the curse of the long verse\\r\\nor prose romance. Moreover, to get point and appeal, it was especially\\r\\nnecessary to <i>throw up</i> the subject&mdash;incident, emotion, or whatever it\\r\\nwas&mdash;to bring it out; not merely to meander and palaver about it. But\\r\\nlanguage and literature were both too much in a state of transition to\\r\\nadmit of anything capital being done at this time. It was the great good\\r\\nfortune of England, corresponding to that experienced with Chaucer in\\r\\npoetry three quarters of a century earlier, that Malory came to give the\\r\\nsum and substance of what medi&aelig;val fiction could do in prose. For more,\\r\\nthe times and the men had to come.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_II\" id=\"CHAPTER_II\" /><a name=\"Page_32\" id=\"Page_32\" />CHAPTER II</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>FROM LYLY TO SWIFT</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>During the dying-off of romance proper, or its transference from verse\\r\\nto prose in the late fifteenth and earlier sixteenth century, there is\\r\\nnot very much to note about prose fiction in England. But, as the\\r\\nconditions of modern literature fashioned themselves, a very great\\r\\ninfluence in this as in other departments was no doubt exercised with us\\r\\nby Italian, as well as some by Spanish in a way which may be postponed\\r\\nfor a little. The Italian prose tale had begun to exercise that\\r\\ninfluence as early as Chaucer\\'s time: but circumstances and atmosphere\\r\\nwere as yet unfavourable for its growth. It is a hackneyed truism that\\r\\nItalian society was very much more modern than any other in Europe at\\r\\nthis time&mdash;in fact it would not be a mere paradox to say that it was,\\r\\nand continued to be till the later sixteenth, much more modern than it\\r\\nhas ever been since&mdash;or till very recently. By &quot;modern&quot; is here meant\\r\\nthe kind of society which is fairly cultivated, fairly comfortable,\\r\\nfairly complicated with classes not very sharply separated from each\\r\\nother, not dominated by any very high ideals, tolerably corrupt, and\\r\\nsufficiently business-like. The Italian <i>novella</i>, of course, admits\\r\\nwild passions and extravagant crimes: but the general tone of it is\\r\\n<i>bourgeois</i>&mdash;at any rate domestic. With its great number of situations\\r\\nand motives, presented in miniature, careful work is necessary to bring\\r\\nout the effect: and, above all, there is abundant room for study of\\r\\nmanners, for proverbial and popular wisdom and witticism, for\\r\\n&quot;furniture&quot;&mdash;to use <a name=\"Page_33\" id=\"Page_33\" />that word in a wide sense. Above all, the Italian\\r\\nmind, like the Greek, had an ethical twist&mdash;twist in more senses than\\r\\none, some would say, but that does not matter. Manners, morals,\\r\\nmotives&mdash;these three could not but displace, to some extent, mere\\r\\nincident: though there was generally incident of a poignant or piquant\\r\\nkind as well. In other words the <i>novella</i> was actually (though still in\\r\\nminiature) a novel in nature as well as in name. And these <i>novelle</i>\\r\\nbecame, as is generally known, common in English translations after the\\r\\nmiddle of the sixteenth century. Painter\\'s huge <i>Palace of Pleasure</i>\\r\\n(1566) is only the largest and best known of many translations, single\\r\\nand collected, of the Italian <i>novellieri</i> and the French tale-tellers,\\r\\ncontemporary, or of times more or less earlier.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For some time, as almost everybody knows, these collections of\\r\\ntranslated matter served a purpose&mdash;great indeed, but somewhat outside\\r\\ntheir proper department&mdash;by furnishing the Elizabethan dramatists with a\\r\\nlarge part&mdash;perhaps the larger part&mdash;of their subjects. But they very\\r\\nsoon began to exercise it directly by suggesting the fictitious part of\\r\\nthe prose pamphlet&mdash;a department which, though infinitely less well\\r\\nknown than the plays, and still not very easy to know, holds almost the\\r\\nsecond position as representing the popular literature of the\\r\\nElizabethan time. And they also had&mdash;in one case certainly, in the other\\r\\nprobably&mdash;no little influence upon the two great Elizabethan works which\\r\\nin a manner founded the modern novel and the modern romance in\\r\\nEnglish&mdash;the <i>Euphues</i> of Lyly and the <i>Arcadia</i> of Sir Philip Sidney.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The pamphlet stories (which are themselves often play-connected, as in\\r\\nthe case of Lodge\\'s <i>Rosalynde</i> and Greene\\'s <i>Pandosto</i>) do not require\\r\\nmuch notice, with one exception&mdash;Nash\\'s <i>Jack Wilton or the Unfortunate\\r\\nTraveller</i>, to which <a name=\"Page_34\" id=\"Page_34\" />some have assigned a position equal, or perhaps\\r\\nsuperior in our particular subject, to that of the <i>Arcadia</i> or that of\\r\\n<i>Euphues</i>. This seems to the present writer a mistake: but as to appear\\r\\nimportant is (in a not wholly unreal sense) to be so, the piece shall be\\r\\nseparately considered. The rest are mostly marred by a superabundance of\\r\\nrather rudimentary art, and a very poor allowance of matter. There is\\r\\nhardly any character, and except in a few pieces, such as Lodge\\'s\\r\\n<i>Margarite of America</i>, there is little attempt to utilise new scenes\\r\\nand conditions. But the whole class has special interest for us in one\\r\\npeculiarity which makes it perhaps unreadable to any but students, and\\r\\nthat is its saturation with the Elizabethan conceit and word-play which\\r\\nis sometimes called Euphuism. Nor is this wonderful, considering that\\r\\nmore than one of these &quot;pamphlets&quot; is directly connected with the matter\\r\\nand the personages of <i>Euphues</i> itself. To this famous book, therefore,\\r\\nwe had better turn.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some people, it is believed, have denied that <i>Euphues</i> is a novel at\\r\\nall; and some of these some have been almost indignant at its being\\r\\ncalled one. It is certainly, with <i>Rasselas</i>, the most remarkable\\r\\nexample, in English, of a novel which is to a great extent deprived of\\r\\nthe <i>agr&eacute;mens</i> to which we have for some two centuries been accustomed\\r\\nin the kind, and, to a still greater, loaded with others which do not\\r\\nappeal to us. To put aside altogether its extraordinary and in a way\\r\\nepoch-making style, which gives it its main actual place in the history\\r\\nof English literature, it is further loaded with didactic digressions\\r\\nwhich, though certain later novelists have been somewhat peccant in the\\r\\nkind, have never been quite equalled&mdash;no, not in <i>Rasselas</i> itself or\\r\\nthe <i>Fool of Quality</i>. But if anybody, who has the necessary knowledge\\r\\nto understand, and therefore the <a name=\"Page_35\" id=\"Page_35\" />necessary patience to tolerate, these\\r\\nknotty knarry envelopes, insertions, and excrescences, will for the\\r\\nmoment pay no attention to them, but merely strip them off, he will find\\r\\nthe carcass of a very tolerable novel left behind. The first plot of\\r\\nPhilautus&mdash;Euphues&mdash;Lucilla, and the successive jilting of the two\\r\\nfriends for each other and for Curio, is no mean novel-substance. Not\\r\\nBalzac himself, certainly no one of his successors, need disdain it: and\\r\\nmore than one of them has taken up something like it. The journey from\\r\\nNaples to London, and the episode of Fidus and Iffida, could have been\\r\\nworked up, in the good old three-volume days, to a most effective second\\r\\nvolume. And the picture of the court, with the further loves of\\r\\nPhilautus, Camilla, and the &quot;violet&quot; Frances, would supply a third of\\r\\nthemselves even if Euphues were left out, though some livelier\\r\\npresentation of his character (which Lyly himself was obviously too much\\r\\npersonally interested to make at all clear) would improve the whole\\r\\nimmensely. But it was still too early: the thing was not yet to be done.\\r\\nOnly, I do not know any book in which the possibilities, and even the\\r\\noutlines, of this thing were indicated and vaguely sketched earlier in\\r\\nany European language, unless it be the <i>Lucretia and Euryalus</i> of &AElig;neas\\r\\nSilvius, which is much more confined in its scope.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The fact is that the very confusedness, the many undeveloped sides, of\\r\\n<i>Euphues</i>, make it much more of an ancestor of the modern novel than if\\r\\nit were more of a piece. The <i>quicquid agunt homines</i> is as much the\\r\\nprovince of the novel as of the satire; and there is more than something\\r\\nof this as it affected Elizabethan times in <i>Euphues</i>. Men\\'s interest in\\r\\nmorals, politics, and education; their development of the modern idea of\\r\\nsociety; their taste for letters; their conceits and fancies&mdash;all these\\r\\nappear in it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_36\" id=\"Page_36\" />The <i>Arcadia</i> stands in a different compartment. <i>Euphues</i> is very much\\r\\n<i>sui generis</i>: failure as it may be from some points of view, it\\r\\ndeserves the highest respect for this, and like most other things <i>sui\\r\\ngeneris</i> it was destined to propagate the genus, if only after many\\r\\ndays. The <i>Arcadia</i> was in intention certainly, and to great extent in\\r\\nactual fact, merely a carrying out of the attempt, common all over\\r\\nEurope (as a result of the critical searchings of heart of the\\r\\nItalians), to practise a new kind&mdash;the Heroic Romance of the sub-variety\\r\\ncalled pastoral. The &quot;heroic&quot; idea generally was (as ought to be, but\\r\\nperhaps is not, well known) to blend, after a fashion, classical and\\r\\nromantic characteristics&mdash;to substitute something like the classic unity\\r\\nof fable or plot for the mere &quot;meandering&quot; of romantic story, and to pay\\r\\nat least as much attention to character as the classics had paid,\\r\\ninstead of neglecting it altogether, as had recently though not always\\r\\nbeen the case in Romance. But the scheme retained on the other hand the\\r\\nvariety of incident and appeal of this latter: and especially assigned\\r\\nto Love the high place which Romance had given it. As for the\\r\\nPastoral&mdash;that is almost a story to itself, and a story which has been\\r\\nonly once (by Mr. W.W. Greg) satisfactorily, and then not quite\\r\\ncompletely, told. It is enough to say here, and as affecting our own\\r\\nsubject, that it supplied a new opportunity of gratifying the passion of\\r\\nthe Renaissance for imitating antiquity, at the same time permitting to\\r\\nno small extent the introduction of things that were really romantic,\\r\\nand above all providing a convention. The Heroic romance generally and\\r\\nthe Pastoral in particular went directly back to the Greek romances of\\r\\nHeliodorus and Longus: but they admitted many new and foreign elements.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the same time, bastard as the heroic romance was, it <a name=\"Page_37\" id=\"Page_37\" />could not but\\r\\nexercise an important influence on the future of fiction, inasmuch as it\\r\\ncombined, or attempted to combine, with classical unity and medi&aelig;val\\r\\nvariety the more modern interest of manners and (sometimes) personality.\\r\\nSidney\\'s attempt (which, it must be remembered, is not certainly known\\r\\nto be wholly his as it stands, and <i>is</i> certainly known not to have been\\r\\nrevised by him for publication) exercised a very great influence in\\r\\nEnglish. For its popularity was enormous, and it doubtless served as\\r\\nshoehorn to draw on that of the English translations of French and\\r\\nSpanish romance which supplied, during the greater part of the\\r\\nseventeenth century, the want of original composition of the kind. The\\r\\nunconscionable amount of talk and of writing &quot;about it and about it&quot;\\r\\nwhich <i>Euphues</i> and the minor Euphuist romances display is at least as\\r\\nprominent in the <i>Arcadia</i>: and this talk rarely takes a form congenial\\r\\nto the modern novel reader\\'s demands. Moreover, though there really is a\\r\\nplot, and a sufficient amount of incident, this reader undoubtedly, and\\r\\nto no small extent justly, demands that both incident and plot shall be\\r\\nmore disengaged from their framework&mdash;that they should be brought into\\r\\nhigher relief, should stand out more than is the case. Yet further, the\\r\\npure character-interest is small&mdash;is almost nonexistent: and the\\r\\nrococo-mosaic of manners and sentiment which was to prove the curse of\\r\\nthe heroic romance generally prevents much interest being felt in that\\r\\ndirection.<a id=\"footnotetag1\" name=\"footnotetag1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\"><sup>1</sup></a> It would also be impossible to devise a style less suited\\r\\nto prose narrative, except of a very peculiar kind and on a small scale,\\r\\nthan that either of <i>Euphues</i> or of the <i>Arcadia</i>, <a name=\"Page_38\" id=\"Page_38\" />which, though an\\r\\nuncritical tradition credits it with driving out Lyly\\'s, is practically\\r\\nonly a whelp of the same litter. Embarrassed, heavy, rhetorical, it has\\r\\nits place in the general evolution of English prose, and a proper and\\r\\nvaluable place too. But it is bad even for pure romance purposes: and\\r\\nnearly hopeless for the panoramic and kaleidoscopic variety which should\\r\\ncharacterise the novel. To the actual successors of the <i>Arcadia</i> in\\r\\nEnglish we shall come presently.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>The Unfortunate Traveller</i> is of much less importance than the other\\r\\ntwo. It has obtained such reputation as it possesses, partly because of\\r\\nits invention or improvement of the fable of &quot;Surrey and Geraldine&quot;;\\r\\nmore, and more justly, because it does work up a certain amount of\\r\\nhistorical material&mdash;the wars of Henry VIII. in French Flanders&mdash;into\\r\\nsomething premonitory (with a little kindness on the part of the\\r\\npremonished) of the great and long missed historical novel; still more\\r\\nfor something else. Nash, with his quick wit, seems to have been really\\r\\nthe first to perceive the capabilities of that foreign travel and\\r\\nobservation of manners which was becoming common, stripped of the\\r\\nspecial atmosphere of pilgrimage which had formerly enveloped it. Even\\r\\nhere, he had had the &quot;notion of the notion&quot; supplied to him by Lyly in\\r\\n<i>Euphues</i>: and a tolerably skilful advocate would not have so very much\\r\\ndifficulty in claiming the book as one of the tribe of Euphuist\\r\\npamphlets. But Jack Wilton the &quot;traveller&quot; is a little more of a person\\r\\nthan the pedagogic Euphues and the shadowy Philautus. At any rate he has\\r\\na very strong anticipation of Defoe, whose &quot;Cavalier&quot; was not improbably\\r\\nsuggested by him. But Nash has neither the patience of Defoe, nor that\\r\\nsingular originality, which accompanies in the author of <i>Moll Flanders</i>\\r\\na <a name=\"Page_39\" id=\"Page_39\" />certain inability to make the most of it. <i>The Unfortunate Traveller</i>\\r\\nis a sort of compilation or congeries of current <i>fabliaux, novelle</i>,\\r\\nand <i>faceti&aelig;</i>, with the introduction of famous actual persons of the\\r\\ntime, from the crowned heads of the period, through Luther and Aretine\\r\\ndownwards, to give bait and attraction. Sometimes it reminds one of a\\r\\nworking up of the <i>Colloquies</i> of Erasmus: three centuries earlier than\\r\\n<i>The Cloister and the Hearth</i>, with much less genius than Charles\\r\\nReade\\'s, and still more without his illegitimate advantage of actual\\r\\nnovels behind him for nearly half the time. But it gives us &quot;disject&aelig;\\r\\nmembra <i>novell&aelig;</i>&quot; rather than a novel itself: and the oftener one reads\\r\\nit the more clear one is that the time for writing novels had not yet\\r\\ncome. The materials are there; the desire to utilise&mdash;and even a faint\\r\\nvague idea of <i>how</i> to utilise&mdash;them is there; but the art is almost\\r\\ncompletely absent. Even regarded as an early attempt in the &quot;picaresque&quot;\\r\\nmanner, it is abortive and only half organised.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The subject of the English &quot;Heroic&quot; Romance, in the wide sense, is one\\r\\nwhich has been very little dealt with. Dunlop neglected it rather\\r\\nsurprisingly, and until Professor Raleigh\\'s chapter on the subject there\\r\\nwas little of a satisfactory kind to be found about it anywhere. It\\r\\nmust, however, be admitted that the abstainers from it have been to some\\r\\nextent justified in their abstention. The subject is a curious one: and\\r\\nit has an important place in the history of the Novel, because it shows\\r\\nat once how strong was the <i>nisus</i> towards prose fiction and how\\r\\nsurprisingly difficult writers seem, nevertheless, to have found it to\\r\\nhit upon anything really good, much more anything really original in\\r\\nkind. For it is hardly too much to say that this century of attempt&mdash;we\\r\\ncannot call it a century of invention&mdash;from Ford to Congreve, does not\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_40\" id=\"Page_40\" />add a single piece of any considerable merit to the roll of English\\r\\nbooks. As for a masterpiece, there is nothing in respect of which the\\r\\nuse of such a word would not be purely ridiculous. And yet the attempts\\r\\nare interesting to the historian, and should not be uninteresting to the\\r\\nhistorical student of literature. One or two of them have a sort of\\r\\nshadowy name and place in literary history already.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In tracing their progress and character, we must allow for two native\\r\\nmodels: and for three foreign sources, one ancient, two modern, of\\r\\ninfluence. <i>The Arcadia</i> and <i>Euphues</i>, the former continuously, the\\r\\nlatter by revival after an interval, exercised very great effect in the\\r\\nfirst half of the seventeenth century, during at least the earlier part\\r\\nof which the vogue of <i>Amadis</i> and its successors, as Englished by\\r\\nAnthony Munday and others, likewise continued. The Greek romances also\\r\\nhad much to do with the matter: for the Elizabethan translators had\\r\\nintroduced them to the vulgar, and the seventeenth century paid a good\\r\\ndeal of attention to Greek. Then, when that century itself was on its\\r\\nway, the pastoral romance of D\\'Urf&eacute; first, and the Calpren&egrave;de-Scud&eacute;ry\\r\\nproductions in the second place, came to give a fresh impulse, and\\r\\nsomething of a new turn. The actual translations of French and Spanish\\r\\nromance, shorter and longer, good, bad, and indifferent, are of immense\\r\\nbulk and doubtless excited imitation: but we cannot possibly deal with\\r\\nthem here. A bare list would fill a chapter. But some work of more or\\r\\nless (generally less) originality, in at least adaptation, calls for a\\r\\nlittle individual notice: and some general characterisation may be\\r\\nadded.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It may be desirable to prelude the story by a reminder to the reader\\r\\nthat the <i>general</i> characteristics of these various sources were\\r\\n&quot;harlequin&quot; in their diversity of apparent colour. The <i>Amadis</i> romances\\r\\nand, indeed, all the later <a name=\"Page_41\" id=\"Page_41\" />examples of that great kind, such as <i>Arthur\\r\\nof Little Britain</i>, which Berners translated, were distinguished on the\\r\\none side by a curious convention of unsmooth running of the course of\\r\\nlove, on the other sometimes by a much greater licence of morality than\\r\\ntheir predecessors, and always by a prodigality of the &quot;conjuror\\'s\\r\\nsupernatural&quot;&mdash;witches and giants and magic black and white. The Spanish\\r\\n&quot;picaresque&quot; story was pretty real but even less decent: and its French\\r\\nimitations (though not usually reaching the licence of the short tale,\\r\\nwhich clung to <i>fabliau</i> ways in this respect) imitated it here also.\\r\\nThe French heroic romance, on the other hand, observed the most\\r\\nscrupulous propriety in language and situation: but aggravated the\\r\\nAmadisian troubling of the course of true love, and complicated\\r\\neverything, very frequently if not invariably, by an insinuated &quot;key&quot;\\r\\ninterest of identification of the ancient personages selected as heroes\\r\\nand heroines with modern personages of quality and distinction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Emanuel Ford (whom the British Museum catalogue insists on spelling\\r\\nFord<i>e</i> and of whom very little seems to be known) published <i>Parismus,\\r\\nPrince of Bohemia</i>, as early as 1598. In less than a hundred years\\r\\n(1696) it had reached its fourteenth edition, and it continued to be\\r\\npopular in abridged and chap-booked form<a id=\"footnotetag2\" name=\"footnotetag2\"></a><a href=\"#footnote2\"><sup>2</sup></a> far into the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury. (It is sometimes called <i>Parismus and Parismenus</i>: the second\\r\\npart being, as very commonly in romances of the class after the <i>Amadis</i>\\r\\npattern, occupied largely with the adventures of the son of the hero of\\r\\nthe first.) On the whole, <i>Parismus</i>, though it has few pretensions to\\r\\nelegance of style, and though some delicate tastes have been shocked at\\r\\ncertain licences of incident, descrip<a name=\"Page_42\" id=\"Page_42\" />tion, and phrase in it, is quite\\r\\nthe best of our bunch in this kind. It is, in general conception, pure\\r\\n<i>Amadis</i> of the later and slightly degraded type. Laurana, the heroine\\r\\n(of whom a peculiarly hideous portrait adorns the black-letter editions\\r\\nside by side with Parismus himself, who is rather a &quot;jolly gentleman&quot;)\\r\\nis won with much less difficulty and in much less time than Oriana&mdash;but\\r\\nseparations and difficulties duly follow in &quot;desolate isles&quot; and the\\r\\nlike. And though Parismus himself is less of an Amadis than Amadis, the\\r\\n&quot;contrast of friends,&quot; founded by that hero and Galaor, is kept up by\\r\\nhis association with a certain Pollipus&mdash;&quot;a man of his hands&quot; if ever\\r\\nthere was one, for with them he literally wrings the neck of the\\r\\nenchantress Bellona, who has enticed him to embrace her. There is plenty\\r\\nof the book, as there always should be in its kind (between 400 and 500\\r\\nvery closely printed quarto pages), and its bulk is composed of\\r\\nproportionately plentiful fighting and love-making and of a very much\\r\\nsmaller proportion of what schoolboys irreverently call &quot;jaw&quot; than is\\r\\nusual in the class. If it were not for the black letter (which is trying\\r\\nto the eyes) I should not myself object to have no other reading than\\r\\n<i>Parismus</i> for some holiday evenings, or even after pretty tough days of\\r\\nliterary and professional work. <i>The Famous History of Montelion, the\\r\\nKnight of the Oracle</i> (1633?) proclaims its Amadisian type even more\\r\\nclearly: but I have only read it in an abridged edition of the close of\\r\\nthe century. I should imagine that <i>in extenso</i> it was a good deal\\r\\nduller than <i>Parismus</i>. And of course the comparative praise which has\\r\\nbeen given to that book must be subject to the reminder that it is what\\r\\nit is&mdash;a romance of disorderly and what some people call childish\\r\\nadventure, and of the above-ticketed &quot;conjuror\\'s supernatural.&quot; If\\r\\nanybody cannot read <i>Amadis</i> itself, he <a name=\"Page_43\" id=\"Page_43\" />certainly will not read\\r\\n<i>Parismus</i>: and perhaps not everybody who can manage the original&mdash;perhaps\\r\\nnot even everybody who can manage <i>Palmerin</i>&mdash;could put up with Ford\\'s\\r\\ncopy. I can take this Ford as I find him: but I am not sure that I would\\r\\ngo much lower.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Ornatus and Artesia</i> (1607?), on the other hand&mdash;his second or third\\r\\nbook&mdash;strikes me as owing more to Heliodorus than to Montalvo, or\\r\\nLobeira, or whoever was the author of the great romance of the last\\r\\nchivalric type. There are more intricacies in it; the heroine plays a\\r\\nrather more important part; there is even something of a nearer approach\\r\\nto modern novel-ways in this production, which reappeared at &quot;Grub\\r\\nStreet near the Upper Pump&quot; in the year 1650. Ornatus sees his mistress\\r\\nasleep and in a kind of deshabille, employs a noble go-between, Adellena\\r\\n(a queer spelling of &quot;Adelina&quot; which may be intentional), is rejected\\r\\nwith apparent indignation, of course; writes elaborate letters in vain,\\r\\nbut overhears Artesia soliloquising confession of her love for him and\\r\\ndisguises himself as a girl, Silvia. Then the villain of the piece,\\r\\nFloretus, to obtain the love of this supposed Silvia, murders a person\\r\\nof distinction and plots to poison Artesia herself. Ornatus-Silvia is\\r\\nbanished: and all sorts of adventures and disguises follow, entirely in\\r\\nthe Greek style. The book is not very long, extending only to signature\\r\\nR in a very small quarto. Except that it is much less lively and\\r\\nconsiderably less &quot;free,&quot; it reminds one rather in type of Kynaston\\'s\\r\\nverse <i>Leoline and Sydanis</i>. In fact the verse and prose romances of the\\r\\ntime are very closely connected: and Chamberlayne\\'s <i>Pharonnida</i>&mdash;far\\r\\nthe finest production of the English &quot;heroic&quot; school in prose, verse, or\\r\\ndrama&mdash;was, when the fancy for abridging set in, condensed into a tiny\\r\\nprose <i>Eromena</i>. But <i>Ornatus and Artesia</i>, if more <a name=\"Page_44\" id=\"Page_44\" />modern, more\\r\\ndecent, and less extravagant than <i>Parismus</i>, is nothing like so\\r\\ninteresting to read. It is indeed quite possible that there is, if not\\r\\nin it, in its popularity, a set-back to the <i>Arcadia</i> itself, which had\\r\\nbeen directly followed in Lady Mary Wroth\\'s <i>Urania</i> (1621), and to\\r\\nwhich (by the time of the edition noted) Charles I.\\'s admiration&mdash;so\\r\\nindecently and ignobly referred to by Milton&mdash;had given a fresh\\r\\nattraction for all good anti-Puritans. That an anti-Puritan should be a\\r\\nromance-lover was almost a necessity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When the French &quot;heroics&quot; began to appear it was only natural that they\\r\\nshould be translated, and scarcely less so that they should be imitated\\r\\nin England. For they were not far off the <i>Arcadia</i> pattern: and they\\r\\nwere a distinct and considerable effort to supply the appetite for\\r\\nfiction which has been dwelt upon. But except for this, and for\\r\\nfashion\\'s sake, they did not contain much that would appeal to an\\r\\nEnglish taste: and it is a little significant that one great reader of\\r\\nthem who is known to us&mdash;Mrs. Pepys&mdash;was a Frenchwoman. Indeed, save for\\r\\nthe very considerable &quot;pastime&quot; of a kind that they gave to a time, much\\r\\nof which required passing, it is difficult to understand their\\r\\nattraction for English readers. Their interminable talk never (till\\r\\nperhaps very recently) was a thing to suit our nation: and the &quot;key&quot;\\r\\ninterest strikes us at any rate as of the most languid kind. But they\\r\\n<i>were</i> imitated as well as translated: and the three most famous of the\\r\\nimitations are the work of men of mark in their different ways. These\\r\\nare the <i>Parthenissa</i> (1654) of Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill and Earl of\\r\\nOrrery; the <i>Aretina</i> (1661) of Sir George Mackenzie; and the <i>Pandion\\r\\nand Amphigeneia</i> (1665) of &quot;starch Johnny&quot; Crowne.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Boyle was a strong Francophile in literature, and his not inconsiderable\\r\\ninfluence on the development of the <a name=\"Page_45\" id=\"Page_45\" />heroic <i>play</i> showed it only less\\r\\ndecidedly than his imitation of the Scud&eacute;ry romance. I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave read <i>Parthenissa</i> through: and I can say that I do not intend to\\r\\ndo so. It is enough to have read Sainte Madeleine of the Ink-Desert\\r\\nherself, without reading bad imitations of her. But I have read enough\\r\\nto know that <i>Parthenissa</i> would never give me anything like the\\r\\nmodified satisfaction that is given by <i>Parismus</i>: and after all, if a\\r\\nman will not take the trouble to finish writing his book (which Orrery\\r\\nnever did) why should his readers take the trouble even to finish\\r\\nreading what he has written? The scene is Parthia, with alternation to\\r\\nSyria, and diversions and episodes elsewhere: and though there is a\\r\\ncertain amount of fighting, the staple is quite decorous but exceedingly\\r\\ndull love-making, conducted partly in the endless dialogue (or rather\\r\\nautomatic monologue) already referred to, and partly in letters more\\r\\n&quot;handsome&quot; even than Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s, and probably a good deal\\r\\nmore sincere in their conventional way, but pretty certainly less\\r\\namusing. The original attraction indeed of this class of novel\\r\\nconsisted, and, in so far as it still exists, may be said to consist, in\\r\\nnoble sentiment, elegantly expressed. It deserved, and in a manner\\r\\ndeserves, the commendatory part of Aramis\\'s rebuke to Porthos for\\r\\nexpressing impatience with the compliments between Athos and D\\'Artagnan\\r\\nat their first and hostile rencounter.<a id=\"footnotetag3\" name=\"footnotetag3\"></a><a href=\"#footnote3\"><sup>3</sup></a> Otherwise there is not much to\\r\\nbe said for it. It does not indeed deserve Johnson\\'s often quoted remark\\r\\nas to Richardson (on whom when we come to him we shall have something\\r\\nmore to say in connection with these heroic romances), if any one were\\r\\nto read <i>Parthenissa</i> for the story he would <a name=\"Page_46\" id=\"Page_46\" />not, unless he were a very\\r\\nimpulsive person, &quot;hang himself.&quot; He would simply, after a number of\\r\\npages varying with the individual, cease to read it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The work of the great Lord Advocate who was traduced by Covenanting\\r\\nmalice is in a certain sense more interesting: and that not merely\\r\\nbecause it is much shorter. <i>Aretina</i> or <i>The Serious Romance</i>, opens\\r\\nwith an &quot;apology for Romances&quot; generally, which goes far to justify\\r\\nDryden\\'s high opinion of Mackenzie as a critic. But it cannot be said to\\r\\nbe much&mdash;it is a little&mdash;more interesting as a story than <i>Parthenissa</i>,\\r\\nand it is written in a most singular lingo&mdash;not displaying the racy\\r\\nquaintness of Mackenzie\\'s elder contemporary and fellow-loyalist\\r\\nUrquhart, but a sort of Scotified and modernised Euphuism rather\\r\\nterrible to peruse. A library is &quot;a bibliotheck richly tapestried with\\r\\nbooks.&quot; Somebody possesses, or is compared to &quot;a cacochymick stomach,\\r\\nwhich transubstantiates the best of meats in its own malignant humour.&quot;\\r\\nAnd when the hero meets a pair of cannibal ruffians he confronts one and\\r\\n&quot;pulling out a pistol, sends from its barrel two balls clothed in\\r\\nDeath\\'s livery, and by them opens a sallyport to his soul to fly out of\\r\\nthat nasty prison.&quot; A certain zest may be given by these oddities, but\\r\\nit hardly lasts out more than 400 pages: and though the lives of Aretina\\r\\nand Philaretes are more simply and straightforwardly told than might be\\r\\nthought likely&mdash;though there are ingenious disguises of contemporary\\r\\npolitics, and though Mackenzie was both a wise man and a wit&mdash;it is more\\r\\ncertain than ever, when we close his book, that this is not the way of\\r\\nthe world, nor the man to walk in that way.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Pandion and Amphigeneia</i> is the inferior in importance of both these\\r\\nbooks. Crowne had perhaps rather more <a name=\"Page_47\" id=\"Page_47\" />talent than it is usual to credit\\r\\nhim with, but he does not show it here. I think Sir Walter Raleigh is\\r\\nquite right in regarding the book as more or less traced over the\\r\\n<i>Arcadia</i>: and it may be said to have all the defects of Sidney\\'s\\r\\nscheme&mdash;which, it is fair once more to observe, we do not possess in any\\r\\nform definitely settled by its author&mdash;with none of the merits of his\\r\\nornament, his execution, and his atmosphere of poetic fancy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The fact is that this heroic romance was foredoomed to inefficiency. It\\r\\nwas not a genuine <i>kind</i> at all: but a sort of patchwork of imitations\\r\\nof imitations&mdash;a mule which, unlike the natural animal, was itself bred,\\r\\nand bred in and in, of mules for generations back. It was true to no\\r\\ntime, to no country, to no system of manners, life, or thought. Its\\r\\noldest ancestor in one sense, though not in another&mdash;the Greek\\r\\nromance&mdash;was itself the growth of the latest and most artificial period\\r\\nof the literature to which it belonged. The pure medi&aelig;val romance of\\r\\nchivalry was another, but of this it had practically nothing left. The\\r\\n<i>Amadis</i> class, the late Renaissance pastorals, the immediately\\r\\npreceding or accompanying French romances of the Scud&eacute;ry type, were, in\\r\\nincreasing degree, hybrid, artificial, and dead-alive. Impotence and\\r\\nsterility in every sense could but be its portion. Of the two great\\r\\nqualities of the novel&mdash;Variety and Life&mdash;it had never succeeded in\\r\\nattaining any considerable share, and it had now the merest show of\\r\\nvariety and no life at all. There is hardly anything to be said in its\\r\\nfavour, except that its vogue, as has been observed, testified to the\\r\\ncraving for prose fiction, and kept at least a simulacrum of that\\r\\nfiction before the public. How far there may be any real, though\\r\\nmetaphysical, connection between the great dramatic output of this\\r\\nseventeenth century in England and its small production in <a name=\"Page_48\" id=\"Page_48\" />novel is a\\r\\nquestion not to be discussed here. But undoubtedly the fact of the\\r\\ncontrast is a &quot;document in the case,&quot; and one of the most important in\\r\\nits own direction; completing the testimony of the medi&aelig;val period in\\r\\nthe other (that as romance dwindled, drama grew) and leading up to that\\r\\nof the eighteenth century when drama dwindled and the novel grew. The\\r\\npractice of Afra Behn in both, and the fact that Congreve, the greatest\\r\\nEnglish dramatist of the close of the century, began with a novel and\\r\\ndeserted the style for drama, are also interesting, and combine\\r\\nthemselves very apparently with the considerations just glanced at. But\\r\\nCongreve and Afra must be postponed for a moment.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The two last discussed books, with <i>Eromena</i> and some others, are\\r\\nposterior to the Restoration in date, but somewhat earlier in type. The\\r\\nreign of Charles II., besides the &quot;heroic&quot; romances and Bunyan, and one\\r\\nmost curious little production to be noticed presently, is properly\\r\\nrepresented in fiction by two writers, to whom, by those who like to\\r\\nmake discoveries, considerable importance has sometimes been assigned in\\r\\nthe history of the English Novel. These are Richard Head and Afra Behn,\\r\\notherwise &quot;the divine Astr&aelig;a.&quot; It is, however, something of an injustice\\r\\nto class them together: for Afra was a woman of very great ability, with\\r\\na suspicion of genius, while Head was at the very best a bookmaker of\\r\\nnot quite the lowest order, though pretty near it. Of <i>The English\\r\\nRogue</i> (1665-1680), which earns him his place here, only the first part,\\r\\nand a certain section of the fourth, are even attributed to him by\\r\\nFrancis Kirkman, the Curll of his generation, who published the thing at\\r\\nintervals and admittedly wrote parts of it himself. It is quite openly a\\r\\npicaresque novel: and imitated not merely from the Spanish originals but\\r\\nfrom Sorel\\'s<a name=\"Page_49\" id=\"Page_49\" /> <i>Francion</i>, which had appeared in France some forty years\\r\\nbefore. Yet, if we compare this latter curious book with Head\\'s we shall\\r\\nsee how very far behind, even with forty years\\' advantage in time, was\\r\\nthe country which, in the next century, was practically to create the\\r\\nmodern novel. <i>Francion</i> is not a work of genius: and it does not\\r\\npretend to much more than the usual picaresque farrago of adventure,\\r\\nunmoral and sometimes rather cruel, but comic of a kind, strung together\\r\\nwith little art in fable, and less in character. But the author is to\\r\\nsome extent &quot;cumbered about serving.&quot; He names his characters, tries to\\r\\ngive them some vague personality, furnishes them with some roughly and\\r\\nsketchily painted scenery, and gives us not merely told tales, but\\r\\noccasionally something distantly resembling conversation. Head takes no\\r\\ntrouble of this kind: and Kirkman does not seem to think that any such\\r\\nthing is required of him. Very few of the characters of <i>The English\\r\\nRogue</i> have so much as a name to their backs: they are &quot;a prentice,&quot; &quot;a\\r\\nmaster,&quot; &quot;a mistress,&quot; &quot;a servant,&quot; &quot;a daughter,&quot; &quot;a tapster,&quot; etc. They\\r\\nare invested with hardly the slightest individuality: the very hero is a\\r\\nscoundrel as characterless as he is nameless:<a id=\"footnotetag4\" name=\"footnotetag4\"></a><a href=\"#footnote4\"><sup>4</sup></a> he is the mere thread\\r\\nwhich keeps the beads of the story together after a fashion. These beads\\r\\nthemselves, moreover, are only the old anecdotes of &quot;coney-catching,&quot;\\r\\nover-reaching, and worse, which had separately filled a thousand\\r\\n<i>fabliaux, novelle</i>, &quot;jests,&quot; and so forth: and which are now flung\\r\\ntogether in gross, chiefly by the excessively clumsy and unimaginative\\r\\nexpedient of making the personages tell long strings of them as their\\r\\nown experience. When anything more is wanted, accounts of the manners of\\r\\nforeign countries, taken from &quot;voyage-<a name=\"Page_50\" id=\"Page_50\" />and-travel&quot; books; of the tricks\\r\\nof particular trades (as here of piratical book-selling); of anything\\r\\nand everything that the writer\\'s dull fancy can think of, are foisted\\r\\nin. The thing is in four volumes, and it seems that a fifth was intended\\r\\nas a close: but there is no particular reason why it should not have\\r\\nextended to forty or fifty, nay to four or five hundred. It could have\\r\\nhad no real end, just as it has no real beginning or middle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One other point deserves notice. The tone of the Spanish and French\\r\\npicaresque novel had never been high: but it is curiously degraded in\\r\\nthis English example. Fureti&egrave;re honestly called his book <i>Roman\\r\\nBourgeois</i>. Head might have called his, if he had written in French,\\r\\n<i>Roman Canaille</i>. Not merely the sentiments but the very outward\\r\\ntrappings and accidents of gentility are banished from the book. Yet we\\r\\ndo not get any real reality in compensation. Head is no Defoe: he can\\r\\ngive us the company that Colonel Jack kept in his youth and Moll\\r\\nFlanders in her middle age: but he makes not the slightest attempt to\\r\\ngive us Moll or Jack, or even Moll\\'s or Jack\\'s habit, environment,\\r\\nnovel-furniture of any kind whatsoever. The receipt to make <i>The English\\r\\nRogue</i> is simply this: &quot;Take from two to three dozen Elizabethan\\r\\npamphlets of different kinds, but principally of the \\'coney-catching\\'\\r\\nvariety, and string them together by making a batch of shadowy\\r\\npersonages tell them to each other when they are not acting in them.&quot;\\r\\nExcept in a dim sort of idea that a novel should have some bulk and\\r\\nsubstance, it is difficult to see any advance whatever in this\\r\\nmuck-heap&mdash;which the present writer, having had to read it a second time\\r\\nfor the present purpose, most heartily hopes to be able to leave\\r\\nhenceforth undisturbed on his shelves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not in this fashion must the illustrious Afra be spoken of.<a name=\"Page_51\" id=\"Page_51\" /> It is true\\r\\nthat&mdash;since it ceased to be the fashion merely to dismiss her with a\\r\\n&quot;fie-fie!&quot; which her prose work, at any rate, by no means merits&mdash;there\\r\\nhas sometimes been a tendency rather to overdo praise of her, not merely\\r\\nin reference to her lyrics, some of which can never be praised too\\r\\nhighly, but in reference to these novels. <i>Oroonoko</i> or <i>The Royal\\r\\nSlave</i>, with its celebration of the virtues of a noble negro and his\\r\\nlove for his Imoinda, and his brutal ill-treatment and death by torture\\r\\nat the hands of white murderers, undoubtedly took the fancy of the\\r\\npublic. But to see at once Rousseau and Byron in it, Chateaubriand and\\r\\nWilberforce and I know not what else, is rather in the &quot;lunatic, lover,\\r\\nand poet&quot; order of vision. Even Head and Kirkman, as we have observed,\\r\\nhad perceived the advantage of foreign scenery and travel to vary their\\r\\nmatter; Afra had herself been in Guiana; and, as she was of a very\\r\\ninflammable disposition, it is quite possible that some Indian Othello\\r\\nhad caught her fresh imagination. On the other hand, there was the\\r\\nheroic romance, with all its sighs and flames, still the rage: and a\\r\\nmuch less nimble intellect than Afra\\'s, with a much less cosmopolitan\\r\\nexperience, might easily see the use of transposing it into a new key.\\r\\nStill, there is no doubt that <i>The Royal Slave</i> and even its companions\\r\\nare far above the dull, dirty, and never more than half alive stuff of\\r\\n<i>The English Rogue. Oroonoko</i> is a story, not a pamphlet or a mere\\r\\n&quot;coney-catching&quot; jest. To say that it wants either contraction or\\r\\nexpansion; less &quot;talk about it&quot; and more actual conversation; a stronger\\r\\nprojection of character and other things; is merely to say that it is an\\r\\nexperiment in the infancy of the novel, not a following out of secrets\\r\\nalready divulged. It certainly is the first prose story in English which\\r\\ncan be ranked with things that already existed in <a name=\"Page_52\" id=\"Page_52\" />foreign literatures.\\r\\nNor is it the only one of the batch in which advance is seen. &quot;The King\\r\\nof Bantam,&quot; for instance, is the account of an &quot;extravagant,&quot; though not\\r\\nquite a fool, who is &quot;coney-catched&quot; in the old manner. But it opens in\\r\\na fashion very different indeed from the old manner. &quot;This money is\\r\\ncertainly a most devilish thing! I\\'m sure the want of it had been like\\r\\nto ruin my dear Philibella!&quot; and the succeeding adventures are pretty\\r\\nfreshly told. The trick of headlong overture was a favourite with Afra.\\r\\n&quot;The Adventure of the Black Lady&quot; begins, &quot;About the beginning of last\\r\\nJune, as near as I can remember, Bellamira came to town from Hampshire.&quot;\\r\\nIt is a trick of course: and here probably borrowed from the French: but\\r\\nthe line which separates trick from artistic device is an exceedingly\\r\\nnarrow and winding one. At any rate, this plunging into the middle of\\r\\nthings wakes up the reader\\'s attention, and does not permit him to doze.\\r\\n&quot;The Lucky Mistake,&quot; on the other hand, opens with a little landscape,\\r\\n&quot;The river Loire has on its delightful banks, etc.&quot; &quot;The Fair Jilt,&quot; a\\r\\nBandello-like story, begins with an exaltation of Love: and so on. Now\\r\\nthese things, though they may seem matters of course to the mere modern\\r\\nreader, were not matters of course then. Afra very likely imitated; her\\r\\nworks have never been critically edited; and have not served as field\\r\\nfor much origin-hunting. But whether she followed others or not, she led\\r\\nher own division. All these things and others are signs of an awakened\\r\\nconscience&mdash;of a sense of the fact that fiction, to be literature, must\\r\\nbe something more than the relation of a bare fact, tragic, comic, or\\r\\nneutral&mdash;that the novelist is a cook, and must prepare and serve his\\r\\nmaterials with a sauce as much his own as possible, of plot,\\r\\narrangement, character-drawing, scenery, conversation, reflection, and\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_53\" id=\"Page_53\" />what not. That conversation itself&mdash;the subtlest instrument of all and\\r\\nthe most effective for constructing character&mdash;is so little developed,\\r\\ncan only, I think, be accounted for by supposing Afra and others to be\\r\\nunder the not unnatural mistake that conversation especially belonged to\\r\\nthe drama, which was still the most popular form of literature, and in\\r\\nwhich she herself was a copious practitioner. But this mistake was not\\r\\nlong to prevail: and it had no effect on that great contemporary of hers\\r\\nwho would, it is to be feared, have used the harshest language\\r\\nrespecting her, and to whom we now come.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is impossible to share, and not very easy even to understand, the\\r\\nscruples of those who would not admit John Bunyan to a place in the\\r\\nhierarchy and the pedigree of the English novel, or would at best grant\\r\\nhim an outside position in relation to it. Their exquisite reasons, so\\r\\nfar as one can discern them, appear to be (or to concern) the facts that\\r\\n<i>The Pilgrim\\'s Progress</i> and <i>The Holy War</i> are religious, and that they\\r\\nare allegories.<a id=\"footnotetag5\" name=\"footnotetag5\"></a><a href=\"#footnote5\"><sup>5</sup></a> It may be humbly suggested that by applying the\\r\\ndouble rule to verse we can exclude <i>Paradise Lost</i> and the <i>Faerie\\r\\nQueene</i> from the <a name=\"Page_54\" id=\"Page_54\" />succession of English Poetry, whereby no doubt we\\r\\nshall be finely holden in understanding the same: while it is by no\\r\\nmeans certain that, if the exclusion of allegory be pushed home, we must\\r\\nnot cancel <i>Don Quixote</i> from the list of the world\\'s novels. Even in\\r\\nprose, to speak plainly, the hesitation&mdash;unless it comes from the\\r\\nfoolish dislike to things religious, as such, which has been the bigotry\\r\\nof the last generation or two&mdash;comes from the almost equally foolish\\r\\ndetermination to draw up arbitrary laws of literary kind. Discarding\\r\\nprejudice and punctilio, every one must surely see that, in diminishing\\r\\nmeasure, even <i>The Holy War</i> is a novel, and that <i>The Pilgrim\\'s\\r\\nProgress</i> has every one of the four requisites&mdash;plot, character,\\r\\ndescription, and dialogue&mdash;while one of these requisites&mdash;character with\\r\\nits accessory manners&mdash;is further developed in the <i>History of Mr.\\r\\nBadman</i> after a fashion for which we shall look vainly in any division\\r\\nof European literature (except drama) before it. This latter fact has\\r\\nindeed obtained a fair amount of recognition since Mr. Froude drew the\\r\\nattention of the general reader to it in his book on Bunyan, in the\\r\\n&quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series, five-and-twenty years ago: but it must\\r\\nhave struck careful readers of the great tinker\\'s minor works long\\r\\nbefore. Indeed there are very good internal reasons for thinking that no\\r\\nless a person than Thackeray must have known <i>Mr. Badman</i>. This\\r\\nwonderful little sketch, however&mdash;the related history of a man who is an\\r\\nutter rascal both in family and commercial relations, but preserves his\\r\\nreputation intact and does not even experience any deathbed\\r\\nrepentance&mdash;is rather an unconscious study for a character in a novel&mdash;a\\r\\nsketch of a <i>bourgeois</i> Barnes Newcome&mdash;than anything more. It has the\\r\\nold drawback of being narrated, not acted or spoken at first hand: and\\r\\nso, though it is in a sense Fielding at nearly <a name=\"Page_55\" id=\"Page_55\" />his best, more than half\\r\\na century before Fielding attempted <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, no more need be\\r\\nsaid of it. So, too, the religious element and the allegory <i>are</i> too\\r\\nprominent in <i>The Holy War</i>&mdash;the novelist\\'s desk is made too much of a\\r\\npulpit in large parts of it. Other parts, concerning the inhabitants of\\r\\nMansoul and their private affairs, are domestic novel-writing of nearly\\r\\nthe pure kind: and if <i>The Pilgrim\\'s Progress</i> did not exist, it would\\r\\nbe worth while to pick them out and discuss them. But, as it most\\r\\nfortunately does exist, this is not needful.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The only fault with the novel-character of the greater book which might\\r\\npossibly be found by a critic who did not let the allegory bite him, and\\r\\nwas not frightened by the religion, is that there is next to no love\\r\\nelement in it, though there are wedding bells. Mercy is indeed quite\\r\\nnice enough for a heroine: but Bunyan might have bestowed her better\\r\\nthan on a young gentleman so very young that he had not long before made\\r\\nhimself (no doubt allegorically) ill with unripe and unwholesome fruit.\\r\\nBut if he had done so, the suspicions of his brethren&mdash;<i>they</i> were acute\\r\\nenough as it was not to mistake the character of the book, whatever\\r\\nmodern critics may do&mdash;would have been even more unallayable. And, as it\\r\\nis, the &quot;alluring countenance&quot; does shed not a little grace upon the\\r\\nstory, or at least upon the Second Part: while the intenser character of\\r\\nthe First hardly requires this. Any other lack is, to the present\\r\\nwriter, imperceptible. The romance interest of quest, adventure,\\r\\nachievement, is present to the fullest degree: and what is sometimes\\r\\ncalled the pure novel interest of character and conversation is present\\r\\nin a degree not lower. It must be accepted as a great blessing, even by\\r\\nthose who regard Puritanism as an almost unmitigated curse, that its\\r\\nprinciples forbade Bunyan to <a name=\"Page_56\" id=\"Page_56\" />think of choosing the profane and\\r\\nabominable stage-play as the form of his creation. We had had our fill\\r\\nof good plays, and were beginning to drink of that which was worse:\\r\\nwhile we had no good novels and wanted them. Of course the large amount\\r\\nof actual &quot;Tig and Tirry&quot; dialogue (as Dr. Johnson would say) is\\r\\nprobably one of the things which have made precisians shy of accepting\\r\\nthe <i>Progress</i> for what it really is. But we must remember that this\\r\\nencroachment on the dramatic province was exactly what was wanted to\\r\\nremove the reproach of fiction. The inability to put actual conversation\\r\\nof a lively kind in the mouths of personages has been indicated as one\\r\\nof the great defects of the novel up to this time. Except Cervantes, it\\r\\nis difficult to think of any novelist who had shown himself able to\\r\\nsupply the want. Bunyan can do it as few have done it even since his\\r\\ntime. The famous dialogue of Christian and By-ends is only the best&mdash;if\\r\\nit is the best&mdash;of scores nearly or quite as good. The curious\\r\\nintellectual flaccidity of the present day seems to be &quot;put off&quot; by the\\r\\n&quot;ticket&quot; names; but no one who has the true literary sense cares for\\r\\nthese one way or another, or is more disturbed by them than if they were\\r\\nWilkins and Jones. Just as Coleridge observed that to enjoy some kinds\\r\\nof poetry you must suspend disbelief, so, with mere literary fashions,\\r\\nyou must suspend disagreement. We should not call By-ends By-ends now:\\r\\nand whether we should do better or worse nobody, as Plato says, knows\\r\\nbut the Deity. But the best of us would be hard put to it to make\\r\\nBy-ends reveal his By-endishness more perfectly than he does by his\\r\\nconversation, and without any ticket-name at all.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not less remarkable, and only a little less new, is the vividness and\\r\\nsufficiency of the scene painting and setting.<a name=\"Page_57\" id=\"Page_57\" /> It has been said that\\r\\nthe great novelists not only provide us with a world of friends more\\r\\nreal and enjoyable than the actual folk we know, but also with a world\\r\\nfor those friends to live in, more real and far more enjoyable than the\\r\\nworld in which we ourselves sojourn. And this is well seen of Christian.\\r\\nThe Slough of Despond and the terrible overhanging hill; the gateway and\\r\\nthe Interpreter\\'s House and the House Beautiful; the ups and downs of\\r\\nthe road, and the arbours and the giants\\' dens: Beulah and the\\r\\nDelectable Mountains:&mdash;one knows them as one knows the country that one\\r\\nhas walked over, and perhaps even better. There is no description for\\r\\ndescription\\'s sake: yet nothing is wanting of the descriptive kind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet all these things are&mdash;as they should be&mdash;only subsidiary to the main\\r\\ninterest of the Pilgrimage itself. Once more, one may fear that it is no\\r\\ngood sign of the wits of the age that readers should be unable to\\r\\ndiscard familiarity with the argument of the story. It is the way in\\r\\nwhich that argument is worked out and illustrated that is the thing. I\\r\\nhave never myself, since I became thoroughly acquainted with Lydgate\\'s\\r\\nEnglishing of Deguilevile\\'s <i>Pilgrimage of the Soul of Man</i>, had any\\r\\ndoubt that&mdash;in some way or other, direct or indirect, at tenth or\\r\\ntwentieth hand perhaps&mdash;Bunyan was acquainted with it: but this is of no\\r\\nimportance. He might undoubtedly have got all his materials straight out\\r\\nof the Bible. But his working of them up is all his own, and is\\r\\nwonderful. Here, to begin with, is the marvel not merely of a\\r\\ncontinuation which is not a falling off, but of a repetition of the same\\r\\ngeneral scheme with different but closely connected personages, which is\\r\\nentirely free from monotony. One is so accustomed to the facts that\\r\\nperhaps it hardly strikes one at first how extraordinarily audacious the\\r\\nattempt is: nay, <a name=\"Page_58\" id=\"Page_58\" />the very success of it may blind all but critics to\\r\\nthe difficulty. It is no wonder that people tried further continuations\\r\\nand further complications: still less wonder that they utterly failed.\\r\\nProbably even Bunyan himself could not have &quot;done it a third time.&quot; But\\r\\nhe did it these twice with such vividness of figure and action; such\\r\\ncompleteness of fable; such sufficiency of behaviour and of speech as\\r\\nhave scarcely ever been equalled. As ideal as Spenser, as real as Defoe:\\r\\nsuch is Bunyan. And he shows this realism and this idealism in a prose\\r\\nnarrative, bringing the thoughts and actions and characters and speech\\r\\nof fictitious human beings before his readers&mdash;for their inspection\\r\\nperhaps; for their delight certainly. If this is not the being and the\\r\\ndoing of a novelist this deponent very humbly declareth that he knoweth\\r\\nnot what the being and the doing of a novelist are.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We must now turn to two small but noteworthy attempts at the kind, which\\r\\nhave been referred to above.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In 1668 there appeared a very curious little book (entitled at great\\r\\nlength after the manner of the times, but more shortly called <i>The Isle\\r\\nof Pines</i>), which is important in the literary ancestry of Defoe and\\r\\nSwift and not unimportant in itself. Its author was Henry Neville, of\\r\\nthe Nevilles of Billingbeare, son of one Sir Henry and grandson of\\r\\nanother, the grandfather having been of some mark in diplomacy and\\r\\ncourtiership in late Elizabethan and early Jacobean times. The grandson\\r\\nhad had a life of some stir earlier. Born in 1620, and educated at\\r\\nMerton and University Colleges, he had left Oxford without a degree, had\\r\\ntaken the Parliamentary side, but as a rigid Republican and\\r\\nanti-Cromwellite; had been a member of the Rota, and after the\\r\\nRestoration had been arrested in 1663 for supposed treasonable\\r\\npractices, but escaped serious punish<a name=\"Page_59\" id=\"Page_59\" />ment. He lived quietly for more\\r\\nthan thirty years longer and died in 1694. Besides <i>The Isle of Pines</i>\\r\\nhe wrote satirical tracts (the <i>Parliament of Ladies</i> being the best\\r\\nknown), translated Machiavelli, and was evidently a man of parts,\\r\\nthough, like his friend Harrington, something of a &quot;crank.&quot; He seems\\r\\nalso to have been, as some others of the extremer Puritans certainly\\r\\nwere, pretty loose in his construction of moral laws.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>The Isle</i> is a very short book of thirty-one quarto pages: but there is\\r\\na good deal in it, and it must have been very carefully written. A\\r\\ncertain Cornelius van Sloetten writes, &quot;supported by letters from\\r\\nAmsterdam,&quot; how a Dutch ship, driven far out of reckoning in the\\r\\nSouthern Ocean, comes to a &quot;fourth island, near Terra Australis\\r\\nIncognita,&quot; which is inhabited by white people, speaking English, but\\r\\nmostly naked. The headman is a certain William Pine, whose grandfather,\\r\\nGeorge, has left a written account of the origin of the community. This\\r\\nrelates how George was wrecked on the island, the ship perishing &quot;with\\r\\nman and mouse,&quot; except himself, his master\\'s daughter, two white\\r\\nmaidservants, and a negro girl. The island proves pleasant and\\r\\nhabitable: and George, to prevent unfairness and ill-feeling, unites\\r\\nhimself to all his female companions, the quintet living in perfect\\r\\nharmony. Thirty-seven children result: and these at first necessarily\\r\\nintermarry; but after this first generation, a rule is made that\\r\\nbrothers and sisters may not unite&mdash;the descendants of the four original\\r\\nwives forming clans who may marry into the others but not into their\\r\\nown. A wider legal code of fair stringency is arranged, with the\\r\\nsanction of capital and other punishments: and things go so well that\\r\\nthe patriarch musters a tribe of 565 persons by the time he is sixty,\\r\\nand of 1789 twenty years later, when he departs this life, <a name=\"Page_60\" id=\"Page_60\" />piously\\r\\npraying God &quot;to multiply them and send them the true report of the\\r\\ngospel.&quot; The multiplication has duly taken place, and there is something\\r\\nlike a civil war while the Dutch are there; but they interfere with\\r\\nfire-arms to restore order, and leave all well. The writer\\'s cunning is\\r\\nshown by the fact that he does not stop abruptly: but finishes off with\\r\\nsome subsequent and quite <i>verisimilar</i> experiences of the Dutch ship.\\r\\nThe book does not appear to have had a very great popularity in England,\\r\\nthough it was reprinted and abridged at least once, pretty shortly. But\\r\\nit was very popular abroad, was translated into three or four languages,\\r\\nand was apparently taken as a genuine account.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Neville\\'s art is in fact not inconsiderable. Earlier voyages and travels\\r\\nof course supplied him with his technical and geographical details: and\\r\\nthe codification of the Isle of Pines suggests the Bacon-Harrington\\r\\ntradition. But he has got the vividness and realism which have usually\\r\\nbeen lacking before: and though some of his details are pretty &quot;free&quot; it\\r\\nis by no means only through such things that these qualities are\\r\\nsecured. To Cyrano de Bergerac he bears no likeness at all. In fact,\\r\\nthough Neville <i>was</i> a satirist, satire does not seem to have been in\\r\\nany way his object here. Whatever that object may have been, he has\\r\\ncertainly struck, by accident or not, on the secret of producing an\\r\\ninteresting account by ingeniously multiplied and adjusted detail.\\r\\nMoreover, as there is no conversation, the book stands&mdash;accidentally\\r\\nthis time almost without doubt&mdash;at the opposite pole from the\\r\\ntalk-deluged romances of the Scud&eacute;ry type. Whether Defoe actually knew\\r\\nit or not matters exceedingly little: that something of his method, and\\r\\nin a manner the subject of his first and most famous novel, are here\\r\\nbefore him, <a name=\"Page_61\" id=\"Page_61\" />seems quite indisputable. Perhaps not the least piquant\\r\\nthing to do with <i>The Isle of Pines</i> is to contrast it with <i>Oceana</i>. Of\\r\\ncourse the contrast is unfair: nearly all contrasts are. But there is\\r\\nactually, as has been pointed out, a slight contact between the work of\\r\\nthe two friends: and their complete difference in every other respect\\r\\nmakes this more curiously apparent. And another odd thing is that\\r\\nNeville&mdash;&quot;Rota&quot;-republican as he was&mdash;should have adopted patriarchal\\r\\n(one can hardly say <i>legitimate</i>) government here.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Congreve\\'s <i>Incognita</i> (1692), the last seventeenth-century novel that\\r\\nrequires special notice, belongs much more to the class of Afra\\'s tales\\r\\nthan to that of the heroic romances. It is a short story of seventy-five\\r\\nsmall pages only and of the Italian-Spanish imbroglio type. The friends\\r\\nAurelian and Hippolito take each other\\'s names for certain purposes, and\\r\\ntheir beloveds, &quot;Incognita,&quot; Juliana and Leonora, are perplexed\\r\\naccordingly: while family feuds, letter assignations at a convent where\\r\\nthe name of the convent unluckily happens to be torn off, and other\\r\\nstock ingredients of the kind are freely used. Most writers have either\\r\\nsaid nothing about the book or have given it scanty praise; with the\\r\\nexception, Sir Walter Raleigh, I confess that I cannot here agree. Being\\r\\nCongreve\\'s it could not be quite without flashes of wit, but they do not\\r\\nappear to me to be either very numerous or very brilliant; the plot,\\r\\nsuch as it is, is a plot of drama rather than of fiction; and there is\\r\\nno character that I can see. It is in fact only one of a vast multitude\\r\\nof similar stories, not merely in the two languages just referred to,\\r\\nbut in French, which were but to show that the time of the novel was not\\r\\nyet come, even when the time of this century was all but over.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_62\" id=\"Page_62\" />It was quite over, and the first two decades of the next were all but\\r\\nover too, before the way was, to any important extent, further explored:\\r\\nbut important assistance in the exploration was given at the beginning\\r\\nof the second of these decades. The history of the question of the\\r\\nrelations of the Addison-Steele periodical, and especially of the\\r\\n&quot;Coverley Papers,&quot; to the novel is both instructive and amusing to those\\r\\nwho have come to appreciate the humours of literary things. It would\\r\\nprobably have shocked the more orthodox admirers of the <i>Spectator</i>,\\r\\nduring the eighteenth century, to have any such connection or relation\\r\\nso much as hinted. But when people began to consider literature and\\r\\nliterary history in a better arranged perspective, the fact that there\\r\\n<i>is</i> such a connection or relation must have been soon perceived. It has\\r\\nbecome comparatively a commonplace: and now the third stage&mdash;that in\\r\\nwhich people become uneasy and suspicious of the commonplace and obvious\\r\\nand try to turn it topsy-turvy&mdash;has begun.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is of course undeniable that the &quot;Coverley Papers,&quot; as they stand,\\r\\nare not a novel, even on the loosest conception and construction of the\\r\\nterm. There is no plot; some of what should be the most important\\r\\ncharacters are merely heard of, not seen; and the various scenes have no\\r\\nsort of connection, except that the same persons figure in them. But\\r\\nthese undeniable facts do not interfere with two other facts, equally\\r\\nundeniable and much more important. The first is that the papers could\\r\\nbe turned into a novel with hardly any important alteration, and with\\r\\nonly <i>quantum suff.</i> of addition and completion. &quot;The widow&quot; is there in\\r\\nthe background ready to be produced and made a heroine; many of the\\r\\nincidents are told novel-fashion already, and more could be translated\\r\\ninto that <a name=\"Page_63\" id=\"Page_63\" />fashion by the veriest tyro at novel writing who has written\\r\\nat any time during the last one hundred and fifty years. The personages\\r\\nof the club have merely to step down and out; the scenes to be\\r\\nconnected, amplified, and multiplied; the conversation to undergo the\\r\\nsame process.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But the second point is of greater importance still. Not only could the\\r\\n&quot;Coverley Papers,&quot; be made into a novel without the slightest\\r\\ndifficulty, and by a process much of which would be simple enlargement\\r\\nof material; but they already possess, in a fashion which requires no\\r\\nalteration at all, many of the features of the novel, far more\\r\\nsuccessfully hit off than had ever been done before in the novel itself.\\r\\nThis is true of the dialogue to no small extent, and of the description\\r\\neven more: but it is truest of all of the characters. Except Bunyan,\\r\\nnobody in prose fiction had ever made personages so thoroughly spirited\\r\\nas Sir Roger and even the two Wills, Honeycomb and Wimble; while here\\r\\nthere was &quot;no allaying Thames&quot; in the shape of allegory, little\\r\\nmoralising and that of a kind quite human, a plentiful setting of\\r\\nordinary and familiar scene, and a more plentiful and exact adjustment\\r\\nof ordinary and familiar manners. It is true that Addison, partly owing\\r\\nto the undercurrent of his satirical humour (Steele succeeds rather\\r\\nbetter here), has not attained the astonishing verisimilitude of the\\r\\nwriter to whom we shall come next and last but one in this chapter. His\\r\\ncharacters are perfectly natural, but we know, all the while, that they\\r\\nare works of art. But in most of the points just mentioned he has\\r\\nexactly the tricks of the novelist\\'s art that Defoe has not. The smaller\\r\\ntales in the <i>Tatler</i> and its followers undoubtedly did something to\\r\\nremove the reproach from prose fiction, and more to sharpen the appetite\\r\\nfor it. But they were nothing new: the short tale being of un<a name=\"Page_64\" id=\"Page_64\" />known\\r\\nantiquity. The &quot;Coverley Papers&quot; <i>were</i> new and did much more. This new\\r\\nkind of treatment may not have suggested beforehand (it is not certain\\r\\nthat it did not) the extensive novel of character and manners&mdash;the play\\r\\nlengthened, bodied more strongly, and turned into narrative form. But\\r\\nthe process was <i>there</i>; the instances of it were highly reputed and\\r\\nwidely known. It must in almost any case have gone hard but a further\\r\\nstep still would be taken. It was actually taken by the person who had\\r\\nsuggested the periodical essay itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Much has been written about Defoe, but, curiously enough, the least part\\r\\nof what has been written about him has concerned the very part of him\\r\\nthat is read&mdash;his novels. Nay, occasional eccentrics, and not only\\r\\nthese, have shown a sort of disposition to belittle him as a novelist:\\r\\nindeed the stock description of Richardson as the Father of the English\\r\\nNovel almost pointedly rules Defoe out. Yet further, the most adequate\\r\\nand intelligent appreciation of his novel work itself has too often been\\r\\nmainly confined to what is no doubt a subject of exceeding interest&mdash;the\\r\\nspecial means by which he secures the attention, and procures the\\r\\ndelight, of his readers. We shall have to deal with this too. But the\\r\\npoint to which it is wished to draw special attention now is different,\\r\\nand we may reach it best by the ordinary &quot;statement of case.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Almost everybody who knows any literary history, knows that the book by\\r\\nwhich, after thirty or forty years of restless publication in all sorts\\r\\nof prose and rhyme, Defoe niched himself immovably in English\\r\\nliterature, was a new departure by almost an old man. He was all but, if\\r\\nnot quite, sixty when <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> appeared: and a very few\\r\\nfollowing years saw the appearance of his pretty voluminous &quot;minor&quot;\\r\\nnovels. The subject of the <a name=\"Page_65\" id=\"Page_65\" />first every one knows without limitation: it\\r\\nis not so certain, though vigorous efforts have been made to popularise\\r\\nthe others, that even their subjects are clearly known to many people.\\r\\n<i>Captain Singleton</i> (1720), <i>Moll Flanders</i>, and <i>Colonel Jack</i> (both\\r\\n1722) are picaresque romances with tolerably sordid heroes and heroines,\\r\\nbut with the style entirely rejuvenated by Defoe\\'s secret. <i>Roxana</i>\\r\\n(1724), a very puzzling book which is perhaps not entirely his writing,\\r\\nis of the same general class: the <i>Voyage round the World</i> (1725), the\\r\\nleast interesting, but not <i>un</i>interesting, is exactly what its title\\r\\nimports,&mdash;in other words, the &quot;stuffing&quot; of the <i>Robinson</i> pie without\\r\\nthe game. The <i>Memoirs of a Cavalier</i> (1720) approach the historical\\r\\nnovel (or at least the similar &quot;stuffing&quot; of that) and have raised\\r\\ncurious and probably insoluble questions as to whether they are\\r\\ninventions at all&mdash;questions intimately connected with that general one\\r\\nreferred to above. One or two minor things are sometimes added to the\\r\\nlist: but they require no special notice. The seven books just mentioned\\r\\nare Defoe\\'s contribution to the English novel. Let us consider the\\r\\nquality of this contribution first&mdash;and then the means used to attain\\r\\nit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Their novel-quality (which, as has been hinted, has not been claimed so\\r\\nloudly or so steadily as it should have been for Defoe) is the quality\\r\\nof Story-Interest&mdash;and this, one dares say, he not only infused for the\\r\\nfirst time in full dose, but practically introduced into the English\\r\\nnovel, putting the best of the old medi&aelig;val romances aside and also\\r\\nputting aside <i>The Pilgrim\\'s Progress</i>, which is not likely to have been\\r\\nwithout influence on himself. It may be said, &quot;Oh! but the <i>Amadis</i>\\r\\nromances, and the Elizabethan novels, and the \\'heroics\\' must have\\r\\ninterested or they would not have been read.&quot; This looks plausible, <a name=\"Page_66\" id=\"Page_66\" />but\\r\\nis a mistake. Few people who have not studied the history of criticism\\r\\nknow the respectable reluctance to be <i>pleased</i> with literature which\\r\\ndistinguished mankind till very recent times; and which in fact kept the\\r\\nnovel back or was itself maintained by the absence of the novel. In life\\r\\npeople pleased themselves irregularly enough: in literature they could\\r\\nnot get out of the idea that they ought to be instructed, that it was\\r\\nenough to be instructed, and that it was discreditable to ask for more.\\r\\nEven the poet was allowed to delight grudgingly and at his peril; was\\r\\nsuspected because he did delight, and had to pay a sort of heavy\\r\\nlicence-duty for it, in the shape of concomitant instruction to others\\r\\nand good behaviour in himself. In fact he was a publican who was bound\\r\\nto serve stodgy food as well as exhilarating drink.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is impossible to doubt that people were similarly affected to the\\r\\nfiction of the Renaissance and the seventeenth century, at least in its\\r\\nlonger examples&mdash;for the smaller <i>novelle</i> could amuse in their own way\\r\\nsometimes, though they could hardly absorb. It is equally impossible to\\r\\nimagine any one being &quot;enthralled&quot; by <i>Euphues</i>. Admiration, of a kind,\\r\\nmust have been the only passion excited by it. In the <i>Arcadia</i> there is\\r\\na certain charm, but it belongs to the inset verse&mdash;to the almost\\r\\nSpenserian <i>visionariness</i> of parts&mdash;to the gracious lulling atmosphere\\r\\nof the whole. If it had been published in three volumes, one cannot\\r\\nimagine the most enthusiastic novel-reader knocking up a friend late at\\r\\nnight for volume two or volume three. I have said that I can read\\r\\n<i>Parismus</i> for pastime: but the pastime that it provides is certainly\\r\\nnot over-stimulating, and the mild stimulant becomes unsweetened and\\r\\nunlemoned barley-water in books of the <i>Parthenissa</i> class. If with them\\r\\nconversing one forgets all <a name=\"Page_67\" id=\"Page_67\" />time, it must be by the influence of the\\r\\nkind go-between Sleep. We know, of course, that their contemporaries did\\r\\nnot go to sleep over them: but it was because they felt that they were\\r\\nbeing done good to&mdash;that they were in the height of polite society&mdash;that\\r\\ntheir manners were being softened and not allowed to be gross. The time,\\r\\nin its blunt way, was fond of contrasting the attractions of a mistress\\r\\non one side and &quot;a friend and a bottle&quot; on the other. That a novel could\\r\\nenter into competition with either or both, as an interesting and even\\r\\nexciting means of passing the time, would have entered very few heads at\\r\\nall and have been contemptuously dismissed from most of those that it\\r\\ndid enter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Addison and Steele in the &quot;Coverley Papers&quot; had shown the way to\\r\\nconstruct this new spell: Defoe actually constructed it. It may be that\\r\\nsome may question whether the word &quot;exciting&quot; applies exactly to his\\r\\nstories. But this is logomachy: and in fact a well-willing reader <i>can</i>\\r\\nget very fairly excited while the Cavalier is escaping after Marston\\r\\nMoor; while it is doubtful whether the savages have really come and what\\r\\nwill be the event; while it is again doubtful whether Moll is caught or\\r\\nnot; or what has become of those gains of the boy Jack, which can hardly\\r\\nbe called ill-gotten because there is such a perfect unconsciousness of\\r\\nill on the part of the getter. At any rate, if such a reader cannot feel\\r\\nexcitement here, he would utterly stagnate in any previous novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In presence of this superior&mdash;this emphatically and doubly\\r\\n&quot;novel&quot;&mdash;interest, all other things become comparatively unimportant.\\r\\nThe relations of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> to Selkirk\\'s experiences and to one\\r\\nor two other books (especially the already mentioned <i>Isle of Pines</i>)\\r\\nmay not unfitly employ the literary historian who chooses to occupy\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_68\" id=\"Page_68\" />himself with them. The allegory which Defoe alleges in it, and which\\r\\nsome biographers have endeavoured to work out, cannot, I suppose, be\\r\\nabsolutely pooh-poohed, but presents no attractions whatever to the\\r\\npresent writer. Whether the <i>Cavalier</i> is pure fiction, or partly\\r\\nembroidered fact, <i>is</i> a somewhat interesting question, if only because\\r\\nit seems to be impossible to find out the answer: and the same may be\\r\\nsaid of the not impossible (indeed almost more than probable) Portuguese\\r\\nmaps and documents at the back of <i>Captain Singleton</i>. To disembroil the\\r\\nchronological muddle of <i>Roxana</i>, and follow out the tangles of the\\r\\nhide-and-seek of that most unpleasant &quot;lady of pleasure&quot; and her\\r\\ndaughter, may suit some. But, apart from all these things, there abides\\r\\nthe fact that you can <i>read</i> the books&mdash;read them again and again&mdash;enjoy\\r\\nthem most keenly at first and hardly less keenly afterwards, however\\r\\noften you repeat the reading.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As has been partly said, the means by which this effect is achieved, and\\r\\nalso the means by which it is not, are almost equally remarkable. The\\r\\nFour Elements of the novel are sometimes, and not incorrectly, said to\\r\\nbe Plot, Character, Description, and Dialogue&mdash;Style, which some would\\r\\nmake a fifth, being rather a characteristic in another order of\\r\\ndivision. It is curious that Defoe is rebellious or evasive under any\\r\\nanalysis of this kind. His plots are of the &quot;strong&quot; order&mdash;the events\\r\\nsucceed each other and are fairly connected, but do not compose a\\r\\nhistory so much as a chronicle. In character, despite his intense\\r\\nverisimilitude, he is not very individual. Robinson himself, Moll, Jack,\\r\\nWilliam the Quaker in <i>Singleton</i>, even Roxana the cold-blooded and\\r\\ncovetous courtesan, cannot be said not to be real&mdash;they and almost every\\r\\none of the minorities are an immense advance on the colourless and\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_69\" id=\"Page_69\" />bloodless ticketed puppets of the Middle Fiction. But they still want\\r\\n<i>something</i>&mdash;the snap of the fingers of the artist. Moll is perhaps the\\r\\nmost real of all of them and yet one has no flash-sights of her\\r\\nbeing&mdash;never sees her standing out against soft blue sky or\\r\\nthunder-cloud as one sees the great characters of fiction; never hears\\r\\nher steps winding and recognises her gesture as one does theirs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So again his description is sufficient: and the enumerative\\r\\nparticularity of it is even great part of the <i>secret de Polichinelle</i>\\r\\nto which we are coming. But it is far from elaborate in any other way\\r\\nand has hardly the least decoration or poetical quality. Well as we know\\r\\nCrusoe\\'s Island the actual scenery of it is not half so much impressed\\r\\nas that even, for instance, of Masterman Ready\\'s&mdash;it is either of the\\r\\nhuman figures&mdash;Crusoe\\'s own grotesque bedizenment, the savages, Friday,\\r\\nthe Spaniards, Will Atkins&mdash;or of the works of man&mdash;the stockade, the\\r\\nboat, and the rest&mdash;that we think. A little play is made with Jack\\'s\\r\\nglass-house squalor and Roxana\\'s magnificence <i>de mauvais lieu</i>, but not\\r\\nmuch: the gold-dust and deserts of <i>Singleton</i> are a necessary part of\\r\\nthe &quot;business,&quot; but nothing more. <i>Moll Flanders</i>&mdash;in some respects the\\r\\ngreatest of all his books&mdash;has the bareness of an Elizabethan stage in\\r\\nscenery and properties&mdash;it is much if Greenfield spares us a table or a\\r\\nbed to furnish it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of Dialogue Defoe is specially fond&mdash;even making his personages\\r\\nsoliloquise in this after a fashion&mdash;and it plays a very important part\\r\\nin &quot;the secret:&quot; yet it can hardly be classed very high <i>as</i> dialogue.\\r\\nAnd this is at least partly due to the strange <i>drab</i> shapelessness of\\r\\nhis style, which never takes on any brilliant colour, or quaint\\r\\nindividual form.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_70\" id=\"Page_70\" />Yet it is very questionable whether any other style would have suited\\r\\nthe method so well, or would even have suited it at all. For this\\r\\nmethod&mdash;to leave off hinting at it and playing round it&mdash;is one of\\r\\nalmost endless accumulation of individually trivial incident, detail,\\r\\nand sometimes observation, the combined effect of which is to produce an\\r\\ninsensible but undoubting acceptance, on the reader\\'s part, of the facts\\r\\npresented to him. The process has been more than once analysed in that\\r\\ncurious and convenient miniature example of it, the &quot;Mrs. Veal&quot;\\r\\n<i>supercherie</i>: but you may open the novels proper almost anywhere and\\r\\ndiscover it in full operation. Like most great processes of art, this is\\r\\nan adoption and perfecting of habits usual with the most inartistic\\r\\npeople&mdash;a turning to good account of the interminably circumstantial\\r\\nsuperfluities of the common gossip and newsmonger. Very often Defoe\\r\\nactually does not go beyond this&mdash;just as in <i>The Shortest Way with the\\r\\nDissenters</i> he had simply reproduced the actual thoughts and wishes of\\r\\nthose who disliked dissent. But sometimes he got the better of this\\r\\nalso, as in the elaborate building up of Robinson\\'s surroundings and not\\r\\na little in the other books. And there the effect is not only\\r\\nverisimilar but wonderful in its verisimilitude. At any rate, in him,\\r\\nand for English prose and secular fiction, we have first that mysterious\\r\\ncharm of the <i>real that is not real</i>&mdash;of the &quot;human creation&quot;&mdash;which\\r\\nconstitutes the appeal of the novel. In some of the books there is\\r\\nhardly any appeal of any other sort. Moll Flanders, though not unkindly,\\r\\nand &quot;improper&quot; rather from the force of circumstances than from any\\r\\nspecially vicious inclination, is certainly not a person for whom one\\r\\nhas much liking. Colonel Jack, after his youthful experiences in\\r\\npocket-picking, is rather a nonentity, something of a coward, a <a name=\"Page_71\" id=\"Page_71\" />fellow\\r\\nof no particular wits, parts, or definite qualities of any kind. Singleton\\r\\nis a rascal who &quot;plays Charlemagne,&quot; as the French gambling term has it,\\r\\nand endows his repentance with the profits of his sin. As for Roxana there\\r\\nare few more repulsive heroines in fiction&mdash;while the Cavalier and the\\r\\nchief figure in the <i>Voyage Round the World</i> are simply threads on\\r\\nwhich their respective adventures are strung. Even Robinson himself enlists\\r\\nno particular sympathy except of the &quot;put-yourself-in-his-place&quot; kind. Yet\\r\\nthese sorry or negative personages, of whom, in the actual creation of God,\\r\\nwe should be content to know nothing except from paragraphs in the\\r\\nnewspaper (and generally in the police-reports thereof), content us\\r\\nperfectly well with their company through hundreds and thousands of\\r\\nsolid pages, and leave us perfectly ready to enjoy it again after\\r\\na reasonable interval.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This, as has been said, is the mystery of fiction&mdash;a mystery partly set\\r\\na-working in the medi&aelig;val romance, then mostly lost, and now\\r\\nrecovered&mdash;in his own way and according to his own capacity&mdash;by Defoe.\\r\\nIt was to escape others for a little longer and then to be yet again\\r\\nrediscovered by the great quartette of the mid-eighteenth century&mdash;to\\r\\nslip in and out of hands during the later part of that century, and then\\r\\nto be all but finally established, in patterns for everlasting\\r\\npursuance, by Miss Austen and by Scott. But Defoe is really (unless we\\r\\nput Bunyan before him) the first of the magicians&mdash;not the greatest by\\r\\nany means, but great and almost alone in the peculiar talent of making\\r\\nuninteresting things interesting&mdash;not by burlesquing them or satirising\\r\\nthem; not by suffusing or inflaming them with passion; not by giving\\r\\nthem the amber of style; but by serving them &quot;simple of themselves&quot; as\\r\\nthough they actually existed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_72\" id=\"Page_72\" />The position of Defoe in novel history is so great that there is a\\r\\ntemptation to end this chapter with him. But to do so would cause an\\r\\ninconvenience greater than any resulting advantages. For the greatest of\\r\\nDefoe\\'s contemporaries in English letters also comes into our division,\\r\\nand comes best here. One cannot conveniently rank Swift with the great\\r\\nquartette of the next chapter, because he is a novelist &quot;by interim&quot; and\\r\\nincompletely: to rank him among the minor and later novelists of the\\r\\neighteenth century would be as to the first part of the classification\\r\\nabsurd and as to the last false. And he comes, not merely in time,\\r\\npretty close to Defoe, incommensurable as is the genius of the two. It\\r\\nhas even been thought (plausibly enough, though the matter is of no\\r\\ngreat importance) that the form of <i>Gulliver</i> may have been to some\\r\\nextent determined by <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and Defoe\\'s other novels of\\r\\ntravel. And there is a subtler reason for taking the pair together and\\r\\nboth close to Addison and Steele.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Swift had shown the general set towards prose fiction, and his own bent\\r\\nin the same direction, long before Defoe\\'s novel-period and as early as\\r\\nthe <i>Tale of a Tub</i> and the <i>Battle of the Books</i> (<i>published</i> 1704 but\\r\\ncertainly earlier in part). The easy flow of the narrative, and the\\r\\nvivid dialogue of the Spider and the Bee in the latter, rank high among\\r\\nthose premonitions of novel with which, in this place, we should be\\r\\nspecially busied. In the former Peter, Martin, and Jack want but a\\r\\nlittle more of the alchemist\\'s furnace to accomplish their projection\\r\\ninto real characters, and not merely allegorical figure-heads. But, of\\r\\ncourse, in both books, the satiric purpose dominates too much to allow\\r\\nthem to be really ranked among novels, even if they had taken the\\r\\ntrouble to clothe themselves with more of the novel-garb.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_73\" id=\"Page_73\" />With <i>Gulliver</i> it is different. It is a commonplace on its subject\\r\\n(but like many other commonplaces a thing ill to forget or ignore) that\\r\\nnatural and unsophisticated children always <i>do</i>, and that almost\\r\\nanybody who has a certain power of turning blind eyes when and where he\\r\\nchooses <i>can</i>, read it simply as a story of adventure and enjoy it\\r\\nhugely. It would be a most preternatural child or a most singularly\\r\\nconstituted adult who could read <i>Utopia</i> or <i>Oceana</i>, or even Cyrano\\'s\\r\\n<i>Voyages</i>, &quot;for the story&quot; and enjoy them hugely. This means that Swift\\r\\nhad either learnt from Defoe or&mdash;and considering those earlier\\r\\nproductions of his own much more probably&mdash;had independently developed\\r\\nthe knack of <i>absorbing</i> the reader&mdash;the knack of telling a story. But\\r\\nof course there is in one sense much more, and in another much less,\\r\\nthan a story in <i>Gulliver</i>: and the finest things in it are independent\\r\\nof story, though (and this once more comes in for our present purpose)\\r\\nthey are quite capable of adaptation to story-purposes, and have been so\\r\\nadapted ever since by the greatest masters of the art. These are strokes\\r\\nof satire, turns of phrase, little illuminations of character, and\\r\\nseasonings of description. But the great point of <i>Gulliver</i> is that,\\r\\nlike Defoe\\'s work, though in not quite the same way, it is\\r\\n<i>interesting</i>&mdash;that it takes hold of its reader and gives him its\\r\\n&quot;peculiar pleasure.&quot; When a work of art does this, it is pretty near\\r\\nperfection.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is, however, another book of Swift\\'s which, though perhaps seldom\\r\\nmentioned or even thought of in connection with the novel, is of real\\r\\nimportance in that connection, and comes specially in with our present\\r\\nmain consideration&mdash;the way in which the several parts of the completed\\r\\nnovel were being, as it were, separately got ready and set apart for the\\r\\nuse of the accomplished novelist. This is the very <a name=\"Page_74\" id=\"Page_74\" />curious and\\r\\nagreeable piece called <i>Polite Conversation</i> (1738), on which, though it\\r\\nwas not printed till late in his life and close on <i>Pamela</i> itself,\\r\\nthere is good reason for thinking that he had been for many years\\r\\nengaged. The importance of dialogue in the novel has been often\\r\\nmentioned and will scarcely be contested: while frequent occasion has\\r\\nbeen taken to point out that it had hitherto been very ill-achieved.\\r\\nSwift\\'s &quot;conversation&quot; though designedly <i>underlined</i>, as it were, to\\r\\nshow up current follies and extravagances of phrase and of fashion\\r\\ngenerally, is yet pretty certainly in the main the real average\\r\\nconversation of the society of his time, which he knew well and\\r\\nthoroughly. Further, there is a distinct, though it may be almost\\r\\nimpalpable, difference between it and the conversation of the stage,\\r\\nthough it is naturally connected therewith. Non-poetical stage dialogue\\r\\nin capable hands is either deliberate talking for display of &quot;wit&quot; like\\r\\nthat of Congreve, or is conditioned and directed by the necessities of\\r\\naction and character. Of course, novel conversation may diverge in the\\r\\nfirst direction, and cannot properly neglect the second altogether. But,\\r\\nas there is room for very much more of it, it may and should allow\\r\\nitself a considerably wider range and imitate, on proper occasions, the\\r\\ndesultory gossip and small talk of people who live on the &quot;boards&quot; of a\\r\\nroom-floor and not of a stage.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is just what Swift\\'s does, and just what there is very little of in\\r\\nDefoe; almost necessarily less in Addison and his group because of their\\r\\nessay form; and hardly anything elsewhere and earlier. Just as the\\r\\nCoverley Papers could, by one process and no difficult one, have been\\r\\nthrown into a novel; so by another, a not much more difficult and a much\\r\\nless complicated one, could the <i>Polite Conversation</i> be thrown into\\r\\npart of a novel&mdash;while in each case the <a name=\"Page_75\" id=\"Page_75\" />incomplete and unintentional\\r\\ndraft itself supplies patterns for the complete work in new kind such as\\r\\nhad never been given before. Indeed the <i>Conversation</i> may almost be\\r\\nsaid to <i>be</i> part of a novel&mdash;and no small part&mdash;as it stands, and of\\r\\nsuch a novel as had never been written before.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But there was something still further all but absolutely necessary to\\r\\nthe novel, though not necessary to it alone, which Defoe, Addison, and\\r\\nSwift, each in his several way, worked mightily to supply: and that was\\r\\na flexible business-like &quot;workaday&quot; prose style. Not merely so long as\\r\\nmen aimed at the eccentric and contorted styles of <i>Euphues</i> and the\\r\\n<i>Arcadia</i>, but so long as the old splendid and gorgeous, but cumbrous\\r\\nand complicated pre-Restoration style lasted, romances were possible,\\r\\nbut novels were not. You might indeed pick out of Shakespeare&mdash;especially\\r\\nfrom such parts as those of Beatrice, Rosalind, and some of the fools&mdash;a\\r\\ncapital novel-style: but then you can pick almost anything out of\\r\\nShakespeare. Elsewhere the constant presence either of semi-poetic\\r\\nphraseology or of some kind of &quot;lingo&quot; was almost fatal. You want what\\r\\nSprat calls a more &quot;natural way of speaking&quot; (though not necessarily a\\r\\n&quot;naked&quot; one) for novel purposes&mdash;a certain absence of ceremony and parade\\r\\nof phrase: though the presence of slang and some other things, the rebuking\\r\\nof which was partly Swift\\'s object in the <i>Conversation</i>, is <i>not</i>\\r\\nfatal, and so he, in a manner, blessed and prescribed what he meant to ban.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thus, by the early years of the reign of George II., or a little later,\\r\\nwe find, on the one side, an evident, and variously though\\r\\ninarticulately proclaimed, desire for novels; on the other, the\\r\\naccumulation, in haphazard and desultory way, of almost all the methods,\\r\\nthe processes, the &quot;plant,&quot; necessary to turn novels out; but hardly\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_76\" id=\"Page_76\" />anything except the considered work of Bunyan, Defoe, and Swift which\\r\\nreally deserves the name of novel. A similar process had been going on\\r\\nin France; and, in the different work of Le Sage and Marivaux, had\\r\\nactually produced work in the kind more advanced than anything in\\r\\nEnglish. But the tables were soon to be turned: and during the rest of\\r\\nthe century the English Novel was at last to assert itself as a\\r\\ndistinct, an increasingly popular, and a widely cultivated kind. That\\r\\nthis was due to the work of the four great novelists who fill its\\r\\ncentral third and will fill our next chapter cannot perhaps be said:\\r\\nthat their work was the first great desertion of it may be said safely.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_III\" id=\"CHAPTER_III\" /><a name=\"Page_77\" id=\"Page_77\" />CHAPTER III</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>THE FOUR WHEELS OF THE NOVEL WAIN</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It does not enter into the plan, because it would be entirely\\r\\ninconsistent with the scale, of the present book to give details of the\\r\\nlives of the novelists, except when they have something special to do\\r\\nwith the subject, or when (as in the case of a few minorities who happen\\r\\nto be of some importance) even well-informed readers are likely to be\\r\\nquite ignorant about them. Accounts, in all degrees of scale and\\r\\ncompetence, of the lives of Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne\\r\\nabound. It is sufficient&mdash;but in the special circumstances at this point\\r\\nperhaps necessary&mdash;here to sum the facts very briefly in so far as they\\r\\nbear on the main issue. Richardson (1689-1761), not merely the first to\\r\\nwrite, but the eldest by much more than his priority in writing, was the\\r\\nson of a Derbyshire tradesman, was educated for some time at\\r\\nCharterhouse, but apprenticed early to a printer&mdash;which trade he pursued\\r\\nwith diligence and profit for the rest of his life in London and its\\r\\nimmediate neighbourhood. After his literary success, he gathered round\\r\\nhim a circle of ladies and gentlemen interested in literature: but he\\r\\nnever had any first-hand acquaintance with general society of the\\r\\n&quot;gentle&quot; kind, much less with that of the upper classes. Fielding\\r\\n(1707-1754), on the contrary, was a member (though only as the son of a\\r\\nyounger son of a younger son) of a family of great antiquity and\\r\\ndistinction, which held an earldom in England and another in Ireland,\\r\\nand was connected as well as <a name=\"Page_78\" id=\"Page_78\" />it was derived, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,\\r\\nfor instance, being the novelist\\'s cousin. He was educated at Eton and\\r\\nLeyden: but his branch of the family being decidedly impecunious, was\\r\\nthrown very much on his own resources. These were mainly drawn from\\r\\nliterature, first as a playwright then as a novelist, journalism and\\r\\nmiscellanies coming in. But he was called to the Bar: and though he\\r\\nprobably did not make much money there, he obtained the poorly paid and\\r\\nhard-worked but rather important position of &quot;Bow Street Magistrate,&quot;\\r\\nwhich meant that he was head, directly of the London police such as it\\r\\nwas, and indirectly of that of the whole kingdom. His temper was in some\\r\\nways as aristocratic as his birth: but though Horace Walpole\\'s accounts\\r\\nof his fancy for low company are obviously exaggerated, there is no\\r\\ndoubt that he was a good deal of what has since been called a\\r\\n&quot;Bohemian.&quot; His experience of variety in scene was much wider than\\r\\nRichardson\\'s, although after he came home from Leyden (where he went to\\r\\nstudy law) it was chiefly confined to London and the south of England\\r\\n(especially Bath, Dorsetshire, where he lived for a time, and the\\r\\nWestern Circuit), till his last voyage, in hopeless quest of health, to\\r\\nLisbon, where he died. His knowledge of literature, and even what may be\\r\\ncalled his scholarship, were considerable, and did credit to the public\\r\\nschool education of those days.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smollett (1721-1771) differed from his two predecessors in being a\\r\\nScotsman: but in family was very much nearer to Fielding than to\\r\\nRichardson, being the grandson of a judge who was a Commissioner of the\\r\\nUnion, and a gentleman of birth and property&mdash;which last would, had he\\r\\nlived long enough, have come to Smollett himself. But he suffered in his\\r\\nyouth from some indistinctly known family jars, was apprenticed to a\\r\\nGlasgow surgeon, and <a name=\"Page_79\" id=\"Page_79\" />escaping thence to London with a tragedy in his\\r\\npocket, was in undoubted difficulties till (and after) he obtained the\\r\\npost of surgeon\\'s mate on board a man-of-war, and took part in the\\r\\nCarthagena expedition. After coming home he made at least some attempts\\r\\nto practise: but was once more drawn off to literature, though\\r\\nfortunately not to tragedy. For the rest of his life he was a\\r\\nhard-worked but by no means ill-paid journalist, novelist, and\\r\\nmiscellanist, making as much as &pound;2000 by his <i>History of England</i>, not\\r\\nill-written, though now never read. Like Fielding (though, unlike him,\\r\\nmore than once) he went abroad in search of health and died in the quest\\r\\nat Leghorn. Smollett was not ignorant, but he seems to have known modern\\r\\nlanguages better than ancient: though there is doubt about his direct\\r\\nshare in the translations to which he gave his name. Moreover he had\\r\\nsome though no great skill in verse.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lastly Sterne (1713-1768), though hardly, as it is the custom to call\\r\\nhim, &quot;an Irishman,&quot; yet vindicated the claims of the third constituent\\r\\nof the United Kingdom by being born in Ireland, from which country his\\r\\nmother came. But the Sternes were pure English, of a gentle family which\\r\\nhad migrated from East Anglia through Nottingham to Yorkshire, and was\\r\\nmuch connected with Cambridge. Thither Laurence, the novelist, after a\\r\\nvery roving childhood (his father was a soldier), and a rather irregular\\r\\neducation, duly went: and, receiving preferment in the Church from his\\r\\nYorkshire relations, lived for more than twenty years in that county\\r\\nwithout a history, till he took the literary world&mdash;hardly by storm, but\\r\\nby a sort of fantastic capful of wind&mdash;with <i>Tristram Shandy</i> in 1760.\\r\\nSeven or eight years of fame, some profit, not hard work (for his books\\r\\nshrink into no great solid bulk), and constant travelling, ended by a\\r\\nsudden death at his<a name=\"Page_80\" id=\"Page_80\" /> Bond Street lodgings, after a long course of\\r\\nill-health very carelessly attended to.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One or two more traits are relevant. All the four were married, and\\r\\nmarried pretty early; two of them married twice. Richardson\\'s first wife\\r\\nwas, in orthodox fashion, his master\\'s daughter: of his second little is\\r\\nknown. Fielding\\'s first (he had made a vain attempt earlier to abduct an\\r\\nheiress who was a relation) was, by universal consent, the model both of\\r\\nSophia and Amelia, almost as charming as either, and as amiable; his\\r\\nsecond was her maid. Of Mrs. Smollett, who was a Miss Lascelles and a\\r\\nWest Indian heiress in a small way, we know very little&mdash;the habit of\\r\\nidentifying her with the &quot;Narcissa&quot; of <i>Roderick Random</i> is natural,\\r\\ninconclusive, but not ridiculous. Sterne\\'s matrimonial relations are the\\r\\nmost famous of all: and though posterity has, with its usual charity,\\r\\nconstructed a legend for the pair which is probably much worse than the\\r\\nreality, that reality is more than a little awkward. Mrs. Sterne was a\\r\\nMiss Lumley, of a good Yorkshire family, some, though small, fortune,\\r\\nand more friends who exerted themselves for her husband. By inexcusable\\r\\nlevity, ignorance, misjudgment, or heartless cupidity their daughter\\r\\nLydia published, after the death of both, letters some of which contain\\r\\ncourtship of the most lackadaisical sentimentality and others later\\r\\nexpressions (which occasionally reach the scandalous) of weariness and\\r\\ndisgust on Sterne\\'s part. Other evidence of an indisputable character\\r\\nshows that he was, at least and best, an extravagant and mawkish\\r\\nphilanderer with any girl or woman who would join in a flirtation: and\\r\\nwhile there is no evidence against Mrs. Sterne\\'s character in the\\r\\nordinary sense, and hardly any of value against her temper, she seems\\r\\n(which is perhaps <a name=\"Page_81\" id=\"Page_81\" />not wonderful) to have latterly preferred to live\\r\\napart from her husband, and to have put him to considerable, if not\\r\\nunreasonable, expenses by her fancy for wandering about France with the\\r\\ndaughter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Finally, in general character, Richardson seems to have been a\\r\\nrespectable person of rather feminine temperament and, though\\r\\ngood-natured to his friends, endowed with a feminine spitefulness.\\r\\nFielding, though by no means answering to the standard of minor and even\\r\\nmajor morals demanded</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\\r\\n<span class=\"i4\">&quot;by the wise ones,<br /></span>\\r\\n<span>By the grave and the precise ones.&quot;<br /></span>\\r\\n</div></div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>though reckless and disorderly in his ways and habits, appears to have\\r\\nbeen in the main a thorough gentleman, faithful to truth and honour,\\r\\nfearless, compassionate, intolerant of meanness and brutality and of\\r\\ntreachery most of all&mdash;a man of many faults perhaps, but of no really\\r\\nbad or disgusting ones. Concerning Smollett\\'s personality we know least\\r\\nof all the four. It was certainly disfigured by an almost savage\\r\\npugnacity of temper; by a strange indifference to what ought to be at\\r\\nthe lowest the conduct of a gentleman, and by a most repulsive\\r\\ninclination&mdash;perhaps natural, but developed by training&mdash;to the merely\\r\\nfoul and nasty. But he seems to have been brave, charitable though not\\r\\nin the most gracious way, honest, and on the whole a much better fellow\\r\\nthan he might generally seem. Sterne is the most difficult of the four\\r\\nto characterise fairly, because of the unlucky revelations to which we\\r\\npossess no parallel in the case of the other three, and which, if we had\\r\\nthem, might probably alter our estimates of a good many now well reputed\\r\\npeople. It is perhaps enough to say that his letters contain many good\\r\\ntraits as well as some bad ones; that his unlucky <a name=\"Page_82\" id=\"Page_82\" />portrait, with its\\r\\ncombination of leer and sneer, is probably responsible for much; and\\r\\nthat the parts which, as we shall see further, he chose to play, of\\r\\nextravagant humorist and extravagant sentimentalist, not only almost\\r\\nnecessitate attitudes which may easily become offensive in the playing,\\r\\nbut are very likely, in practice, to communicate something apparently\\r\\nnot natural and unattractive to the player.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But enough of the workers, though not too much in the case of such\\r\\nremarkable contemporary exponents of a new kind of Human Comedy: let us\\r\\ngo to the work.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the long &quot;History of the Unexpected,&quot; thick-strewn as it is with\\r\\ncuriosities, there are few things odder than the appearance and the\\r\\nsequels of <i>Pamela: or Virtue Rewarded</i>, which, in circumstances to be\\r\\nnoted presently, is said to have been begun on November 12, 1739, was\\r\\nfinished (as far as the first part goes) exactly two months later, and\\r\\n(there being, in the case of the author\\'s business, no obstacle of the\\r\\nkind that has frequently beset the appearance of greater works) was\\r\\npublished later in the year 1740. That author was over fifty years old:\\r\\nthough he had had much to do with ushering literature into the world, he\\r\\nhad never attempted to produce it; he belonged to a class which was apt\\r\\nto regard <i>belles lettres</i> with profound suspicion; and his experiences,\\r\\nboth in literature itself and in life, had been necessarily of the most\\r\\nlimited kind. But there were certain counterbalancing facts to be taken\\r\\ninto consideration which, though they can hardly be said to be <i>causes</i>\\r\\nof the marvel&mdash;the cause was the Hour, which hit, as it listed, on the\\r\\nMan&mdash;were a little more than accidental occasions of it. Richardson, as\\r\\nwe see from his work, must have been a rather careful student of such\\r\\nnovels as there were. The name of his first heroine, with the\\r\\nessentially English throwing back of the accent added, is the <a name=\"Page_83\" id=\"Page_83\" />same as\\r\\nthat of one of Sidney\\'s heroines in the <i>Arcadia</i>, which had been not\\r\\nlong before modernised for eighteenth-century reading by a certain Mrs.\\r\\nStanley. The not very usual form &quot;Laurana,&quot; which is the name of a\\r\\ncharacter in his latest novel, is that of the heroine of <i>Parismus</i>.\\r\\nFurther, he had had curious early experiences (which we know from his\\r\\nown meticulous revelations) of writing love-letters, when he was a mere\\r\\nboy, for girl-friends of his to adapt in writing to their lovers. &quot;His\\r\\neye,&quot; he says, &quot;had been always on the ladies,&quot; though no doubt always\\r\\nalso in the most honourable way. And, quite recently, the\\r\\ncrystallisation had been precipitated by a commission from two of his\\r\\nbookseller (i.e. publisher) patrons&mdash;the founder of the House of\\r\\nRivington and the unlucky Osborne who was knocked down by Johnson and\\r\\npicked up (not quite as one would wish to be) by Pope. They asked him to\\r\\nprepare a series of &quot;Familiar Letters on the useful concerns of common\\r\\nlife.&quot; Five-and-twenty years before, he had heard in outline something\\r\\nlike the story of <i>Pamela</i>. In shaping this into letters he thought it\\r\\nmight be a &quot;new species of writing that might possibly turn young people\\r\\ninto a course of reading different from the pomp and parade of\\r\\nromance-writing, and dismissing the improbable and marvellous with which\\r\\nnovels generally abound, might tend to promote the cause of religion and\\r\\nvirtue.&quot; His wife and &quot;a young lady living with them,&quot; to whom he had\\r\\nread some of it, used to come into his little closet every night with,\\r\\n&quot;Have you any more of <i>Pamela</i>, Mr. R.?&quot; Two other female friends joined\\r\\nin the interest and eulogy. He finished it (that is, the first two\\r\\nvolumes which contain the whole of the original idea) and published it,\\r\\nthough at first with the business-like precaution of appearing to &quot;edit&quot;\\r\\nonly, and the more business-like liberty of liberal <a name=\"Page_84\" id=\"Page_84\" />praise of what he\\r\\nedited. It became at once popular: and received the often repeated, but\\r\\nto the author very annoying, compliment of piratical continuation. So he\\r\\nset to work and continued it himself: as usually (though by no means\\r\\ninvariably) with rather diminished success. On such points as the\\r\\nsuggestion that he may have owed a debt to Marivaux (in <i>Marianne</i>) and\\r\\nothers, little need be said here. I have never had much doubt myself\\r\\nthat the indebtedness existed: though it would be rash, and is\\r\\nunnecessary, to attempt to determine to what extent and in what\\r\\nparticular form.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is by no means so difficult as it may at first sight appear to put\\r\\noneself very much in the situation of a contemporary reader of <i>Pamela</i>,\\r\\neven if one has read it three or four times, provided that a fairly long\\r\\nperiod has elapsed since the last reading, and that the novels of the\\r\\npreceding age are fairly&mdash;and freshly&mdash;familiar. The thing has been in\\r\\nfact done&mdash;with unexpected but not in the least deliberate or suspicious\\r\\nsuccess&mdash;by the present writer, who has read the book after an interval\\r\\nof some fifteen years and just after reading (in some cases again, in\\r\\nsome for the first time) most of the works noticed in the preceding\\r\\nchapter. The difference of &quot;the new species of writing&quot; (one is reminded\\r\\nof the description of Spenser as &quot;the new poet&quot;) is almost startling:\\r\\nand of a kind which Richardson pretty certainly did not fully apprehend\\r\\nwhen he used the phrase. In order to appreciate it, one must not only\\r\\nleave out the two last volumes (which, as has been said, the first\\r\\nreaders had not before them at all, and had better never have had) but\\r\\nalso the second, or great part of it, which they would only have reached\\r\\nafter they had been half whetted, half satiated, and wholly bribed, by\\r\\nthe first. The defects of this later part and indeed of the first itself\\r\\nwill be duly <a name=\"Page_85\" id=\"Page_85\" />noticed presently. Let it be to us, for the moment, the\\r\\nstory of Pamela up to and including &quot;Mr. B.\\'s&quot; repentance and amendment\\r\\nof mind: and the &quot;difference&quot; of this story, which fills some hundred\\r\\nand twenty or thirty closely printed, double columned, royal octavo\\r\\npages in the &quot;Ballantyne Novels,&quot; is (despite the awkwardness of such a\\r\\nform for the enjoyment of a novel) almost astounding.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To begin with, the novel-attractions are presented with a completeness\\r\\nwhich, as has been pointed out in the last chapter, is almost entirely\\r\\nlacking before. There is, of course, not very much plot, in the martinet\\r\\nsense of that word: there never was in Richardson, despite his immense\\r\\napparatus and elaboration. The story is not knotted and unknotted; the\\r\\nwheel does not come full circle on itself; it merely runs along\\r\\npleasantly till it is time for it to stop, and it stops rather abruptly.\\r\\nThe siege of Pamela\\'s virtue ends merely because the besieger is tired\\r\\nof assaults which fail, and of offering dishonourable terms of\\r\\ncapitulation which are rejected: because he prefers peace and alliance.\\r\\nBut such as it is, it is told with a spirit which must have been\\r\\nsurprising enough to its readers, and which makes it, I confess, seem to\\r\\nme now much the best <i>story</i> in Richardson. The various alarums and\\r\\nexcursions of the siege itself go off smartly and briskly: there may be\\r\\nmore sequence than connection&mdash;there is <i>some</i> connection, as in the\\r\\ncase of that most unlucky and ill-treated person the Rev. Mr.\\r\\nWilliams&mdash;but the sequence is rapid and unbroken, and the constituents\\r\\nof it as it were jostle each other&mdash;not in any unfavourable sense, but\\r\\nin a sort of rapid dance, &quot;cross hands and down the middle,&quot; which is\\r\\ninspiriting and contagious. He lost this faculty later: or rather he\\r\\nallowed it to be diluted and slackened into the interminable episodes of\\r\\nthe not dissimilar though worse-starred plot <a name=\"Page_86\" id=\"Page_86\" />against Clarissa, and the\\r\\n<i>massacrant</i> trivialities of the Italian part of <i>Grandison</i>. But he had\\r\\nit here: and it is not a fair argument to say (as even in these days I\\r\\nhave known it said) that Pamela\\'s honour is a commodity of too little\\r\\nimportance to justify such a pother about it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This may bring us to the characters. They also are not of the absolutely\\r\\nfirst class&mdash;excepting, as to be discussed later, the great attempt of\\r\\nLovelace, Richardson\\'s never are. But they are an immense advance on the\\r\\npersonages that did duty as persons in preceding novels, even in Defoe.\\r\\n&quot;Mr. B.&quot; himself is indeed not very capital. One does not quite see why\\r\\na man who went on as long as he did and used the means which he\\r\\npermitted himself to use, did not go on longer or use them more\\r\\nthoroughly. But Richardson has at least vindicated his much-praised\\r\\n&quot;knowledge of the human heart&quot; by recognising two truths: first, that\\r\\nthere are many natures (perhaps most) who are constantly tempted to\\r\\n&quot;over-bid&quot;&mdash;to give more and more for something that they want and\\r\\ncannot get; and, secondly, that there are others (again, perhaps, the\\r\\nmajority, if not always the same individuals) who, when they are\\r\\nperemptorily told <i>not</i> to do a thing, at once determine to do it. It\\r\\nwas to Lady Davers mainly that Pamela owed her escape from the fate of\\r\\nClarissa, though she would hardly have taken, or had the chance of\\r\\ntaking, that fate in the same way. As for the minor characters, at least\\r\\nthe lower examples are more than sufficient: and Mrs. Jewkes wants very\\r\\nlittle of being a masterpiece. But of course Pamela herself is the\\r\\ncynosure, such as there is. She has had rather hard measure with critics\\r\\nfor the last century and a little more. The questions to ask now are,\\r\\n&quot;Is she a probable human being?&quot; and then, &quot;Where are we to find a\\r\\nprobable human being, worked out to the same degree, before?&quot;<a name=\"Page_87\" id=\"Page_87\" /> I say\\r\\nunhesitatingly that the answer to the first is &quot;Yes,&quot; and the answer to\\r\\nthe second &quot;Nowhere.&quot; The last triumph of originality and individuality\\r\\nshe does not indeed reach. Richardson had, even more than other men of\\r\\nhis century in England, a strong Gallic touch: and he always tends to\\r\\nthe type rather than the individual. Beatrix Esmond is a coquette of the\\r\\nhighest&mdash;almost of the heroic-poetic&mdash;class, but she is first of all\\r\\nBeatrix Esmond. Blanche Amory is a middle-class minx, hardly heroic at\\r\\nall, but she is first of all Blanche Amory. Becky Sharp is an\\r\\nadventuress who would go pretty close to, and perhaps not stop at,\\r\\npositive crime, but she is first of all Becky Sharp. Pamela Andrews is\\r\\nnot first of all&mdash;perhaps she is hardly at all&mdash;Pamela Andrews. There\\r\\nmight be fifty or five hundred Pamelas, while there could be only one of\\r\\neach of the others. She is the pretty, good-natured, well-principled,\\r\\nand rather well-educated menial, whose prudence comes to the aid of her\\r\\nprinciples, whose pride does not interfere with either, and who has a\\r\\ncertain&mdash;it is hardly unfair to call it&mdash;slyness which is of the sex\\r\\nrather than of the individual. But, as such, she is quite admirably\\r\\nworked out&mdash;a heroine of Racine in more detail and different\\r\\ncircumstances, a triumph of art, and at the same time with so much\\r\\nnature that it is impossible to dismiss her as merely artificial. The\\r\\nnearest thing to her in English prose fiction before (Marianne, of\\r\\ncourse, is closer in French) is Moll Flanders: and good as Moll is, she\\r\\nis flat and lifeless in comparison with Pamela. You may call &quot;my\\r\\nmaster\\'s&quot; mistress (actually in the honourable sense, but never in the\\r\\ndishonourable) again a minx, though a better minx than Blanche, if you\\r\\nlike. But there is no animal more alive than a minx: and you will\\r\\ncertainly not find a specimen of the species in any English novel\\r\\nbefore.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_88\" id=\"Page_88\" />As for description and dialogue, there is not very much of the former\\r\\nin <i>Pamela</i>, though it might not be unfair to include under the head\\r\\nthose details, after the manner of Defoe (such as Pamela\\'s list of\\r\\npurchases when she thinks she is going home), which supply their own\\r\\nmeasure of verisimilitude to the story. But there are some things of the\\r\\nkind which Defoe never would have thought of&mdash;such as the touches of\\r\\nthe &quot;tufts of grass&quot; and the &quot;pretty sort of wildflower that grows\\r\\nyonder near the elm, the fifth from us on the left,&quot; which occur in the\\r\\ngipsy scene. The dialogue plays a much more important part: and may be\\r\\nbrought into parallel with that in the <i>Polite Conversation</i>, referred\\r\\nto above and published just before <i>Pamela</i>. It is &quot;reported&quot; of course,\\r\\ninstead of being directly delivered, in accordance with the\\r\\nletter-scheme of which more presently, but that makes very little\\r\\ndifference; to the first readers it probably made no difference at all.\\r\\nHere again that process of &quot;vivification,&quot; which has been so often dwelt\\r\\non, makes an astonishing progress&mdash;the blood and colour of the novel,\\r\\nwhich distinguish it from the more statuesque narrative, are supplied,\\r\\nif indirectly yet sufficiently and, in comparison with previous\\r\\nexamples, amply. Here you get, almost or quite for the first time in the\\r\\nEnglish novel, those spurts and sparks of animation which only the\\r\\nliving voice can supply. Richardson is a humorist but indirectly; yet\\r\\nonly the greatest humorists have strokes much better than that admirable\\r\\ntouch in which, when the &quot;reconciliations and forgivenesses of injuries&quot;\\r\\nare being arranged, and Mr. B. (quite in the manner of the time)\\r\\nsuggests marrying Mrs. Jewkes to the treacherous footman John and giving\\r\\nthem an inn to keep&mdash;Pamela, the mild and semi-angelic but exceedingly\\r\\nfeminine Pamela, timidly inquires whether, &quot;This would not look <a name=\"Page_89\" id=\"Page_89\" />like\\r\\nvery heavy punishment to poor John?&quot; She forgives Mrs. Jewkes of course,\\r\\nbut only &quot;as a Christian&quot;&mdash;as a greater than Richardson put it\\r\\nafterwards and commented on it in the mouth of a personage whom\\r\\nRichardson could never have drawn, though Fielding most certainly could.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The original admirers of <i>Pamela</i>, then, were certainly justified: and\\r\\neven the rather fatuous eulogies which the author prefixed to it from\\r\\nhis own and (let us hope) other pens (and which probably provoked\\r\\nFielding himself more than even the substance of the piece) could be\\r\\ntransposed into a reasonable key. But we ought nowadays to consider this\\r\\nfirst complete English novel from a rather higher point of view, and ask\\r\\nourselves, not merely what its comparative merits were in regard to its\\r\\npredecessors, and as presented to its first readers, but what its\\r\\npositive character is and what, as far as it goes, are the positive\\r\\nmerits or defects which it shows in its author.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first thing to strike one in this connection is, almost of course,\\r\\nthe letter-form. More agreement has been reached about this, perhaps,\\r\\nthan about some other points in the inquiry. The initial difficulty of\\r\\nfiction which does not borrow the glamour of verse or of the stage is\\r\\nthe question, &quot;What does all this mean?&quot; &quot;What is the authority?&quot; &quot;How\\r\\ndoes the author know it all?&quot; And a hundred critics have pointed out\\r\\nthat there are practically only three ways of meeting this. The boldest\\r\\nand the best by far is to follow the poet and the dramatist themselves;\\r\\nto treat it like one of the magic lions of romance, ignore it, and pass\\r\\non, secure of safety, to tell your story &quot;from the blue,&quot; as if it were\\r\\nan actual history or revelation, or something passing before the eyes of\\r\\nthe reader. But at that time few novelists had the courage to do this,\\r\\ndaunted as they were by the absence of the sword and shield of <a name=\"Page_90\" id=\"Page_90\" />verse,\\r\\nof the vantage-room of the stage. Then there is the alternative of\\r\\nrecounting it by the mouth of one of the actors in, or spectators of,\\r\\nthe events&mdash;a plan obvious, early, presenting some advantages, still\\r\\nvery commonly followed, but always full of little traps and pits of\\r\\nimprobability, and peculiarly trying in respect to the character (if he\\r\\nis made to have any) of the narrator himself. Thirdly, there is the\\r\\nagain easy resource of the &quot;document&quot; in its various forms. Of these,\\r\\nletters and diaries possess some prerogative advantages; and were likely\\r\\nto suggest themselves very particularly at this time when the actual\\r\\nletter and diary (long rather strangely rare in English) had for some\\r\\ngenerations appeared, and were beginning to be common. In the first\\r\\nplace the information thus obtained looks natural and plausible: and\\r\\nthere is a subsidiary advantage&mdash;on which Richardson does not draw very\\r\\nmuch in <i>Pamela</i>, but which he employs to the full later&mdash;that by\\r\\nvarying your correspondents you can get different views of the same\\r\\nevent, and first-hand manifestations of extremely different characters.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Its disadvantages, on the other hand, are equally obvious: but there are\\r\\ntwo or three of them of especial importance. In the first place, it is\\r\\nessentially an artificial rather than an artful plan&mdash;its want of\\r\\nverisimilitude, as soon as you begin to think of it, is as great as that\\r\\nof either of the others if not greater. In the second, without immense\\r\\npains, it must be &quot;gappy and scrappy,&quot; while the more these pains are\\r\\ntaken the more artificial it will become. In the third, the book is\\r\\nextremely likely, in the taking of these pains and even without them, to\\r\\nbecome intolerably lengthy and verbose. In the first part at least of\\r\\nthe first part of <i>Pamela</i>, Richardson avoided these dangers fairly if\\r\\nnot fully; in the second part he succumbed <a name=\"Page_91\" id=\"Page_91\" />to them; in his two later\\r\\nnovels, though more elaborate and important plots to some extent bore up\\r\\nthe expansion, he succumbed to them almost more. Pains have been taken\\r\\nabove to show how the first readers of <i>Pamela</i> might rejoice in it,\\r\\nbecause of its contrast with the character of the seventeenth-century\\r\\nnovel which was most read&mdash;the Scud&eacute;ry or &quot;heroic&quot; romance. It is not, I\\r\\nthink, too severe to say that nothing but the parallel with that\\r\\nromance, and the tolerance induced by familiarity with it, could make\\r\\nany one put up with the second part of <i>Pamela</i> itself, or with the\\r\\ninhumanly prolonged divagation of <i>Clarissa</i> and <i>Grandison</i>. Nor, as\\r\\nhas been hinted, is the solace of the letters&mdash;in the opportunity of\\r\\nsetting forth different tempers and styles&mdash;here much taken.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no doubt that one main attraction of this letter-plan (whether\\r\\nconsciously experienced or not does not matter) was its ready adaptation\\r\\nto Richardson\\'s own special and peculiar gift of minute analysis of\\r\\nmood, temper, and motive. The diary avowedly, and the letter in reality,\\r\\neven though it may be addressed to somebody else, is a continuous\\r\\nsoliloquy: and the novelist can use it with a frequency and to a length\\r\\nwhich would be intolerable and impossible on the stage. Now soliloquy is\\r\\nthe great engine for self&mdash;revelation and analysis. It is of course to a\\r\\ngreat extent in consequence of this analysis that Richardson owes his\\r\\npride of place in the general judgment. It is quite possible to lay too\\r\\nmuch stress on it, as distinguishing the novel from the romance: and the\\r\\npresent writer is of opinion that too much stress has actually been\\r\\nlaid. The real difference between romance <i>per se</i> and novel <i>per se</i>\\r\\n(so far as they are capable of distinct existence) is that the romance\\r\\ndepends more on incident and the novel more on character. Now this\\r\\nminute <a name=\"Page_92\" id=\"Page_92\" />analysis and exhibition, though it is one way of drawing or\\r\\nconstructing character, is not the only, nor even a necessary, one. It\\r\\ncan be done without: but it has impressed the vulgar, and even some who\\r\\nare not the vulgar, from Dr. Johnson to persons whom it is unnecessary\\r\\nto mention. They cannot believe that there is &quot;no deception&quot;&mdash;that the\\r\\ntime is correctly told&mdash;unless the works of the watch are bared to them:\\r\\nand this Richardson most undoubtedly does. Even in his \\'prentice work,\\r\\nevery flutter of Pamela\\'s little heart is registered, and registered\\r\\nprobably enough: nor could the registry have been effected, perhaps, in\\r\\nany other way that should be in the least probable so well as by the\\r\\nletter and journal method. Of course this analysis was not quite new; it\\r\\nhad existed in a sort of way in the heroic novel: and it had been\\r\\neminently present in the famous <i>Princesse de Cl&egrave;ves</i> of Madame de la\\r\\nFayette as well as in her French successors. But these stories had\\r\\ngenerally been as short as the heroics had been long: and no one had\\r\\nrisen (or descended) to anything like the minuteness and fullness of\\r\\nRichardson. As was before pointed out in regard to the letter-system\\r\\ngenerally, this method of treatment is exposed to special dangers,\\r\\nparticularly those of verbosity and &quot;overdoing&quot;&mdash;not to mention the\\r\\ngreater one of missing the mark. Richardson can hardly be charged with\\r\\nerror, though he may be with excess, in regard to Pamela herself in the\\r\\nearlier part of the book&mdash;perhaps even not in regard to Mr. B.\\'s\\r\\nintricacies of courtship, matrimonial compliment, and arbitrary temper\\r\\nlater. But he certainly succumbs to them in the long and monstrous scene\\r\\nin which Lady Davers bullies, storms at, and positively assaults her\\r\\nunfortunate sister-in-law before she is forced to allow that she <i>is</i>\\r\\nher sister-in-law. Part of course of his error here comes from the\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_93\" id=\"Page_93\" />mistake with which Lady Mary afterwards most justly reproached\\r\\nhim&mdash;that he talked about fine ladies and gentlemen without knowing\\r\\nanything about them. It was quite natural for Lady Davers to be\\r\\ndisgusted, to be incredulous, to be tyrannical, to be in a certain sense\\r\\nviolent. But it is improbable that she would in any case have spoken and\\r\\nbehaved like a drunken fishfag quarrelling with another in the street:\\r\\nand the extreme prolongation of the scene brings its impropriety more\\r\\nforcibly into view. Here, as elsewhere (a point of great importance to\\r\\nwhich I may invite attention), Richardson follows out, with\\r\\nextraordinary minuteness and confidence, a wrong course: and his very\\r\\nexpertness in the process betrays him and brings him to grief. If he had\\r\\nrun the false scent for a few yards only it would not matter: in a chase\\r\\nprolonged to something like &quot;Hartleap Well&quot; extension there is less\\r\\nexcuse for his not finding it out. Nevertheless it would of course be\\r\\nabsurd not to rank this &quot;knowledge of the human heart&quot; among the claims\\r\\nwhich not only gave him but have kept his reputation. I do not know that\\r\\nhe shows it much less in the later part of the first two volumes\\r\\n(Pamela\\'s recurrent tortures of jealous curiosity about Sally Godfrey\\r\\nare admirable) or even in the dreary sequel. But analysis for analysis\\'\\r\\nsake can have few real, though it may have some pretended, devotees.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The foregoing remarks have been designed, less as a criticism of\\r\\n<i>Pamela</i> (which would be unnecessary here), or even of Richardson (which\\r\\nwould be more in place, but shall be given in brief presently), than as\\r\\nan account and justification of the book\\'s position in the real subject\\r\\nof this volume&mdash;the History of the English Novel. And this account will\\r\\ndispense us from dealing, at corresponding length, with the individually\\r\\nmore important but histori<a name=\"Page_94\" id=\"Page_94\" />cally subordinate books which followed. Of\\r\\nthese <i>Clarissa</i>, as few people can be ignorant, is a sort of enlarged,\\r\\ndiversified, and transposed <i>Pamela</i>, in which the attempts of a\\r\\nlibertine of more resolution and higher gifts than Mr. B. upon a young\\r\\nlady of much more than proportionately higher station and qualities than\\r\\nPamela\\'s, are&mdash;as such success goes&mdash;successful at last: but only to\\r\\nresult in the death of the victim and the punishment of the criminal.\\r\\nThe book is far longer than even the extended <i>Pamela</i>; has a much wider\\r\\nrange; admits of episodes and minor plots, and is altogether much more\\r\\nambitious; but still&mdash;though the part of the seducer Lovelace is much\\r\\nmore important than that of Mr. B.&mdash;it is chiefly occupied with the\\r\\nheroine. In <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, on the contrary, though no less\\r\\nthan three heroines exist after a fashion and are carefully treated, the\\r\\nauthor\\'s principal object is to depict&mdash;in direct contrast to Mr. B. and\\r\\nLovelace&mdash;a &quot;Good Man&quot;&mdash;the actual first title of the book, which he\\r\\nwisely altered. This faultless and insufferable monster is frantically\\r\\nbeloved by, and hesitates long between, two beauties, the Italian\\r\\nClementina della Porretta and the English Harriet Byron. The latter of\\r\\nthese carries him off (rather because of religious difficulties than of\\r\\nany great predilection on his own part) and the piece ends with a\\r\\nrepetition, extension, and intensification of the bounties showered upon\\r\\nPamela by her husband, and her almost abject gratitude for them. Only of\\r\\ncourse &quot;the good man&quot; could never be guilty of Mr. B.\\'s meditated\\r\\nrelapse from the path of rectitude, nor (one may perhaps add) does Miss\\r\\nByron seem to possess the insinuating astuteness by which Pamela once\\r\\nmore</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\\r\\n<span>&quot;Reconciles the new perverted man,&quot;<br /></span>\\r\\n</div></div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>to adapt the last line of <i>A Lover\\'s Complaint</i> to the situation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_95\" id=\"Page_95\" /><i>Grandison</i>, like <i>Clarissa</i>, has a much wider range of personage and\\r\\nincident than <i>Pamela</i>, and is again double the length of it. No\\r\\ndetailed criticism of these enormous books (both of which are conducted\\r\\nin the letter-form, though, in the latter case especially, with long\\r\\nretrospects and narratives which rather strain the style) is possible\\r\\nhere. But a few remarks on the characters of Lovelace and Clarissa,\\r\\nwhich have usually been regarded as Richardson\\'s greatest triumphs, may\\r\\nfitly precede some on his whole character as a novelist.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Admiration and sympathy, tempered with a few reserves, have been the\\r\\ngeneral notes of comment on Clarissa: and&mdash;as she goes through the long\\r\\nmartyrdom of persecution by her family for not marrying the man she does\\r\\nnot love; of worse persecution from the man whom she does love, but who\\r\\nwill not marry her, at least until he has conquered her virtue; and of\\r\\nperhaps worst when she feels it her duty to resist his repentant and (as\\r\\nsuch things go) honourable proffers after he has treacherously deprived\\r\\nher of technical honour&mdash;compassion at least is impossible to refuse.\\r\\nBut &quot;compassion,&quot; though it literally translates &quot;sympathy&quot; from Greek\\r\\ninto Latin, is not its synonym in English. It is a disagreeable thing to\\r\\nhave to say: but Clarissa\\'s purity strikes one as having at once too\\r\\nmuch questionable prudery in it and too little honest prudence: while\\r\\nher later resolution has as much false pride as real principle. Even\\r\\nsome of her admirers admit a want of straightforwardness in her; she has\\r\\nno passion, which rather derogates from the merit of her conduct in any\\r\\ncase; and though she is abominably ill-treated by almost everybody,\\r\\none\\'s pity for her never comes very near to love.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Towards Lovelace, on the other hand, the orthodox attitude, with even\\r\\ngreater uniformity, has been shocked, <a name=\"Page_96\" id=\"Page_96\" />or sometimes even unshocked,\\r\\nadmiration. Hazlitt went into frequently quoted raptures over the\\r\\n&quot;regality&quot; of his character: and though to approve of him as a man would\\r\\nonly be the pretence of a cheap paradoxer, general opinion seems to have\\r\\ngone various lengths in the same direction. There have, however, been a\\r\\nfew dissenters: and I venture to join myself to them in the very\\r\\ndissidence of their dissent. Lovelace, it is true, is a most\\r\\nastonishingly &quot;succeeded&quot; blend of a snob\\'s fine gentleman and of the\\r\\nfine gentleman of a silly and rather unhealthy-minded schoolgirl. He\\r\\nis&mdash;it is difficult to resist the temptation of dropping and inserting\\r\\nthe h\\'s&mdash;handsome, haughty, arbitrary, as well as rich, generous after a\\r\\nfashion, well descended, well dressed, well mannered&mdash;except when he is\\r\\ninsolent. He is also&mdash;which certainly stands to his credit in the bank\\r\\nwhich is not that of the snob or the schoolgirl&mdash;no fool in a general\\r\\nway. But he is not in the least a gentleman except in externals: and\\r\\nthere is nothing really &quot;great&quot; about him at all. Even his scoundrelism\\r\\nis mostly, if not wholly, <i>pose</i>&mdash;which abominable thing indeed\\r\\ndistinguishes him throughout, in every speech and every act, from the\\r\\ntime when he sighs as he kisses Miss Arabella Harlowe\\'s hand to the time\\r\\nwhen he says, &quot;Let this expiate!&quot; as that hallowed sword of Colonel\\r\\nMorden\\'s passes through his rotten heart. Now if Richardson had <i>meant</i>\\r\\nthis, it might be granted at once that Lovelace is one of the greatest\\r\\ncharacters of fiction: and I do not deny that <i>taken as this</i>, meant or\\r\\nnot meant, he is great. But Richardson obviously did <i>not</i> mean it; and\\r\\nHazlitt did not mean it; and none of the admirers mean it. <i>They</i> all\\r\\nthought and think that Lovelace is something like what Milton\\'s Satan\\r\\nwas, and what my Lord Byron would have liked to be. This is very unfair\\r\\nto the Prince of<a name=\"Page_97\" id=\"Page_97\" /> Darkness: and it is even not quite just to &quot;the noble\\r\\npoet.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the same time, the acute reader will have noticed, the acknowledgment\\r\\nthat the fact that Richardson&mdash;even not knowing it and intending to do\\r\\nsomething else&mdash;did hit off perfectly and consummately the ideal of such\\r\\na &quot;prevailing party&quot; (to quote Lord Foppington) as snobs and\\r\\nschoolgirls, is a serious and splendid tribute to his merits: as is also\\r\\nthe fact that his two chief characters are characters still interesting\\r\\nand worth arguing about. Those merits, indeed, are absolutely\\r\\nincontestable. His immediate and immense popularity, abroad as well as\\r\\nat home, would not necessarily prove much, though it must not be\\r\\nneglected, and historically, at least, is of the first importance. But\\r\\nhe does not need it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For, as should have been sufficiently shown, he did very great\\r\\nthings&mdash;first by gathering up the scattered means and methods which had\\r\\nbeen half ignorantly hit on by others, and co-ordinating them into the\\r\\nproduction of the finished and complete novel; secondly (though less) by\\r\\nthat infusion of elaborate &quot;minor psychology&quot; as it may be called, which\\r\\nis his great characteristic; and, thirdly, by means of it and of other\\r\\nthings, in raising the pitch of interest in his readers to an infinitely\\r\\nhigher degree than had ever been known before. The dithyrambs of Diderot\\r\\nare, though not ridiculously, amusingly excessive: but they are only an\\r\\nexaggeration of the truth. On the comic side he was weak: and he made a\\r\\nmost unfortunate mistake by throwing this part of the business on young\\r\\nladies of position and (as he thought) of charm&mdash;Miss Darnford, Miss\\r\\nHowe, Charlotte Grandison&mdash;who are by no means particularly comic and\\r\\nwho are sometimes very particularly vulgar. But of tragedy positive, in\\r\\nthe <i>bourgeois</i> kind, he <a name=\"Page_98\" id=\"Page_98\" />had no small command, and in the middle\\r\\nbusiness&mdash;in affairs neither definitely comic nor definitely tragic&mdash;he\\r\\nwas wonderfully prolific and facile. His immense and heart-breaking\\r\\nlengthiness is not <i>mere</i> verbosity: it comes partly from the artist\\'s\\r\\nnatural delight in a true and newly found method, partly from a still\\r\\nmore respectably artistic desire not to do the work negligently. As for\\r\\nthe unhealthiness of atmosphere which has been generally and not\\r\\nunjustly charged upon him, it is, in part, no doubt the result of\\r\\nimperfect temperament and breeding: but it is also as closely connected\\r\\nwith his very method as are the merits thereof. You cannot &quot;consider so\\r\\ncuriously&quot; without considering too curiously. The drawbacks of his work\\r\\nare obvious, and they were likely to be, and were, exaggerated. But they\\r\\nmight be avoided and the merits kept: nor is it too much to say that the\\r\\ntriumphs of the English novel in the last century have been not a little\\r\\ndue to the avoidance of the one and the keeping of the other.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It would be, in the circumstances, peculiarly uncivil and disobliging\\r\\nto lay very much stress on the fact that, after all, the greatest\\r\\nof Richardson\\'s works is his successor, caricaturist, and\\r\\nsuperior&mdash;Fielding. When the memoirs of Miss Pamela Andrews appeared,\\r\\nthe future biographer of her doubly supposititious brother was a not\\r\\nvery young man of thirty-three, who had written a good many not very\\r\\ngood plays, had contributed to periodicals, and had done a little work\\r\\nat the Bar, besides living, at least till his marriage and it may be\\r\\nfeared later, an exceedingly &quot;rackety&quot; life. It is not improbable,\\r\\nthough it is not certain, that he had already turned his attention to\\r\\nprose fiction of a kind. For, though the <i>Miscellanies</i> which followed\\r\\n<i>Joseph Andrews</i> were three years later than<a name=\"Page_99\" id=\"Page_99\" /> <i>Pamela</i> in appearance,\\r\\nthe <i>Journey from this World to the Next</i> which they contain has the\\r\\nimmaturity of earliness; and we can hardly conceive it as written after\\r\\nthe adventures and character of Mr. Abraham Adams. It is unequal, rather\\r\\ntedious in parts, and in conception merely a <i>pastiche</i> of Lucian and\\r\\nFontenelle: but it contains some remarkable things in the way of shrewd\\r\\nsatirical observation of human nature. And the very fact that it is a\\r\\nfollowing of something else is interesting, in connection with the\\r\\ninfinitely more important work that preceded it in publication, <i>The\\r\\nAdventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams</i> (1742).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nobody has ever had much difficulty in accounting for the way in which\\r\\nFielding availed himself of the appearance and popularity of <i>Pamela</i>.\\r\\nAnd though Richardson would have been superhuman instead of very human\\r\\nindeed (with an ordinary British middle-class humanity, and an\\r\\nextraordinary vein of genius) if he had done otherwise, few have joined\\r\\nhim in thinking <i>Joseph</i> a &quot;lewd and ungenerous engraftment.&quot; We have\\r\\nnot ourselves been very severe on the faults of <i>Pamela</i>, the reason of\\r\\nlenity being, among other things, that it in a manner produced Fielding,\\r\\nand all the fair herd of his successors down to the present day. But\\r\\nthose faults are glaring: and they were of a kind specially likely to\\r\\nattract the notice and the censure of a genial, wholesome, and, above\\r\\nall, masculine taste and intellect like Fielding\\'s. Even at that time,\\r\\nlibertine as it was in some ways, and sentimental as it was in others,\\r\\npeople had not failed to notice that Pamela\\'s virtue is not quite what\\r\\nwas then called &quot;neat&quot; wine&mdash;the pure and unadulterated juice of the\\r\\ngrape. The <i>longueurs</i> and the fiddle-faddle, the shameless and fulsome\\r\\npreface-advertisements and the rest lay open enough to <a name=\"Page_100\" id=\"Page_100\" />censure. So\\r\\nFielding saw the handles, and gripped them at once by starting a <i>male</i>\\r\\nPamela&mdash;a situation not only offering &quot;most excellent differences,&quot; but\\r\\nin itself possessing, to graceless humanity at all times it may be\\r\\nfeared, and at that time perhaps specially, something essentially\\r\\nludicrous in minor points. At first he kept the parody very close:\\r\\nthough the necessary transposition of the parts afforded opportunity\\r\\n(amply taken) for display of character and knowledge of nature superior\\r\\nto Richardson\\'s own. Later the general opinion is that he, especially\\r\\ninspirited by his <i>trouvaille</i> of Adams, almost forgot the parody, and\\r\\nonly furbished up the <i>Pamela</i>-connection at the end to make a formal\\r\\ncorrespondence with the beginning, and to get a convenient and\\r\\nconventional &quot;curtain.&quot; I am not so sure of this. Even Adams is to a\\r\\ncertain extent suggested by Williams, though they turn out such very\\r\\ndifferent persons. Mrs. Slipslop, a character, as Gray saw, not so very\\r\\nfar inferior to Adams, is not only a parallel to Mrs. Jewkes, but also,\\r\\nand much more, a contrast to the respectable Mrs. Jervis and Mrs.\\r\\nWarden. All sorts of fantastic and not-fantastic doublets may be traced\\r\\nthroughout: and I am not certain that Parson Trulliber\\'s majestic\\r\\ndoctrine that no man, even in his own house, shall drink when he &quot;caaled\\r\\nvurst&quot; is not a demoniacally ingenious travesty of Pamela\\'s\\r\\ncharacteristic casuistry, when she says that she will do anything to\\r\\npropitiate Lady Davers, but she will not &quot;fill wine&quot; to her in her own\\r\\nhusband\\'s house.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But this matters little: and we have no room for it. Suffice it as\\r\\nagreed and out of controversy that <i>Joseph Andrews</i> started as a parody\\r\\nof <i>Pamela</i> and that, whether in addition or in substitution, it turned\\r\\nto something very different. It is not quite so uncontroversial, but\\r\\nwill be <a name=\"Page_101\" id=\"Page_101\" />asserted here as capable of all but demonstration, that the\\r\\n&quot;something different&quot; is also something much greater. There is still not\\r\\nvery much plot&mdash;the parody did not necessitate and indeed rather\\r\\ndiscouraged that, and what there is is arrived at chiefly by the old and\\r\\nseldom very satisfactory system of <i>anagnorisis</i>&mdash;the long-lost-child\\r\\nbusiness. But, under the three other heads, Joseph distances his sister\\r\\nhopelessly and can afford her much more than weight for sex. It has been\\r\\nsaid that there are doubtfully in Richardson anywhere, and certainly not\\r\\nin <i>Pamela</i>, those startling creations of personality which are almost\\r\\nmore real to us than the persons we know in the flesh. It is not that\\r\\nPamela and her meyney are <i>un</i>real; for they are not: but that they are\\r\\nnot personal. The Reverend Abraham Adams is a good deal more real than\\r\\nhalf the parsons who preached last Sunday, and a good deal more\\r\\npersonal: and the quality is not confined to him, though he has most of\\r\\nit. So, too, with the description. The time was not yet for any minute\\r\\nor elaborate picture-setting. But here again also that extra dose of\\r\\nlife and action&mdash;almost of bustle&mdash;which Fielding knows how to instil is\\r\\npresent. In <i>Pamela</i> the settings are frequent, but they are &quot;still\\r\\nlife&quot; and rather shadowy: we do not <i>see</i> the Bedfordshire and\\r\\nLincolnshire mansions, the summer houses where (as she observes with\\r\\ndemure relish when the danger is over) Mr. B. was &quot;very naughty;&quot; even\\r\\nthe pond where, if she had been another sort of girl, the <i>drame</i> might\\r\\nhave become real tragedy. Fielding does not take very much more trouble\\r\\nand yet somehow we <i>do</i> see it all, with a little help from our own\\r\\nimaginations perhaps, but on his suggestion and start. Especially the\\r\\noutdoor life and scenes&mdash;the inn-yards and the high roads and the downs\\r\\nby night or day; the pig-sty where poor Adams is <a name=\"Page_102\" id=\"Page_102\" />the victim of live\\r\\npigs and the public-house kitchen where he succumbs to a by-product of\\r\\ndead ones&mdash;these are all real for us.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But most of all is the regular progress of vivification visible in the\\r\\ndialogue. This, as we have seen, had been the very weakest point of the\\r\\nweakness of almost all (we might say of all) English novels up to the\\r\\nclose of the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Richardson had\\r\\ndone a great deal for it: but it was impossible that, on his method, it\\r\\nshould not, for the most part, be languid, or at any rate long-winded.\\r\\nHere again Fielding spirits the thing up&mdash;oxygenates and ozonises the\\r\\natmosphere: while, in even fuller measure than his predecessor and\\r\\nvictim, he recognises the efficacy of dialogue as the revealer of\\r\\ncharacter. He has, assisted no doubt by Shakespeare and his own dramatic\\r\\npractice, discovered that you do not want volumes of it to do the\\r\\nbusiness&mdash;that single moments and single sentences will do that business\\r\\nat times, if they are used in the proper way.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In short, Fielding here used his reluctant and indignant forerunner as a\\r\\nspring-board, whence to attain heights which that forerunner could never\\r\\nhave reached: he &quot;stood upon his shoulders&quot; in the most cavalier but\\r\\nalso the most successful fashion. In the novel as Richardson knew it and\\r\\nwas thinking of it, when he began <i>Pamela</i>, you were, as a rule, in an\\r\\nartificial world altogether&mdash;a world artificial with an artificiality\\r\\nonly faintly and occasionally touched with any reality at all. In\\r\\n<i>Pamela</i> itself there is perhaps nothing, and certainly not much, that\\r\\nis <i>wholly</i> unreal: but the reality is treated and rendered in an\\r\\nartificial way. In <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, though its professed genesis and\\r\\nprocedure are artificial too, you break away at once from serious\\r\\nartifice. These are all real people who <a name=\"Page_103\" id=\"Page_103\" />do real things in a real way\\r\\nnow, as they did nearly two hundred years ago: however much dress, and\\r\\nspeech, and manners may have changed. And we are told of their doings in\\r\\na real way, too. Exactly how the teller knew it we do not know: but we\\r\\ndo not think of this at all. And on the other hand there is no perpetual\\r\\nreminder of art, like the letter-ending and beginning, to disturb or\\r\\nalloy the once and gladly accepted &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A slight digression may not be improper here. Even in their own days,\\r\\nwhen the <i>gros mot</i> was much less shocking than it is now, there was a\\r\\ngeneral notion&mdash;which has more or less persisted, in spite of all\\r\\nchanges of fashion in this respect, and exists even now when licence of\\r\\nsubject as distinguished from phrase has to a great extent\\r\\nreturned&mdash;that Fielding is more &quot;coarse,&quot; more &quot;improper,&quot; and so forth\\r\\nthan Richardson. As a matter of fact, neither admits positively indecent\\r\\nlanguage&mdash;that had gone out, except in the outskirts and fringes of\\r\\nEnglish literature, generations earlier. But I am much mistaken if there\\r\\nare not in Richardson more than a few scenes and situations the\\r\\n&quot;impropriety&quot; of which positively exceeds anything in Fielding.\\r\\nNaturally one does not give indications: but readers may be pretty\\r\\nconfident about the fact. The comparative &quot;bloodlessness,&quot; however&mdash;the\\r\\nabsence of life and colour in the earlier and older writer&mdash;acts as a\\r\\nsort of veil to them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet (to return to larger and purer air), however much one may admire\\r\\n<i>Joseph Andrews</i>, the kind of <i>parasitic</i> representation which it allows\\r\\nitself, and the absence of any attempt to give an original story tells\\r\\nagainst it. And it may, in any case, be regarded as showing that the\\r\\nnovelist, even yet, was hugging the shore or allowing himself to be\\r\\ntaken in tow&mdash;that he did not dare to launch out <a name=\"Page_104\" id=\"Page_104\" />into the deep and\\r\\ntrust to his own sails and the wind of nature to propel him&mdash;to his own\\r\\nwits and soul to guide. Even Fielding\\'s next venture&mdash;the wonderful and\\r\\nalmost unique venture of <i>Jonathan Wild</i>&mdash;leaves some objection of this\\r\\nsort possible, though, for myself, I should never dream of admitting it.\\r\\nJonathan was (so much the worse for human nature) a real person: and the\\r\\noutlines of his story&mdash;if not the actual details&mdash;are given partly by\\r\\nhis actual life, partly by Gay\\'s <i>Beggar\\'s Opera</i> and its sequel.\\r\\nMoreover, the whole marvellous little book has a purpose&mdash;the purpose of\\r\\nsatire on false ideas of greatness, historical and political. The\\r\\ninvention and the art of the writer are not even yet allowed frank and\\r\\nfree course.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But though criticism will allow this, it will, if it be competent and\\r\\ncourageous, allow no deduction to be made from the other greatness of\\r\\nthis little masterpiece. It has never been popular; it is never likely\\r\\nto be popular; and one may almost say that it is sincerely to be hoped\\r\\nthat it never will be popular. For if it were, either all the world\\r\\nwould be scoundrels, which would be a pity: or all the world would be\\r\\nphilosophers and persons of taste, in which case it would be impossible,\\r\\nas the famous story has it, to &quot;look down on one\\'s fellow-creatures from\\r\\na proper elevation.&quot; It really is a novel and a remarkable one&mdash;superior\\r\\neven to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, according to Thackeray\\'s own definition, as a\\r\\ndelineation of &quot;a set of people living without God in the world.&quot; But it\\r\\nis even more (and here its only parallel is <i>A Tale of a Tub</i>, which is\\r\\nmore desultory and much more of a <i>fatrasie</i> or salmagundy of odds and\\r\\nends) a masterpiece and quintessential example of irony. Irony had come\\r\\nin with the plain prose style, without which it is almost impossible:\\r\\nand not merely Swift but others had done great things with it. It is,\\r\\nhowever, only <a name=\"Page_105\" id=\"Page_105\" />here that it reaches the quintessence just spoken of with\\r\\na coherent and substantive purpose to serve as vehicle for it. It is\\r\\npossibly too strong for most people\\'s taste: and one may admit that, for\\r\\nanything like frequent enjoyment, it wants a certain admixture of the\\r\\nfantastic in its various senses&mdash;after the method of Voltaire in one\\r\\nway, of Beckford in another, of Peacock in a third, of Disraeli in a\\r\\nfourth&mdash;to make it acceptable to more than a very few. But it shows,\\r\\neven from our present limited point of view, of what immense and exalted\\r\\napplication the novel-method was capable: and it shows also the\\r\\nastonishing powers of its author. &quot;Genial,&quot; in the usual sense, it\\r\\ncertainly cannot be called; in the proper sense as equalling &quot;what is\\r\\nthe production of genius&quot; there are few books which deserve the term\\r\\nbetter. But it is an exercise in a by-way of the novel road-system,\\r\\nthough an early proof of the fact that such by-ways are endlessly open.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But the time was coming, though it did not (and could hardly) come very\\r\\nquickly, when Fielding was to discard all kinds of adventitious aids and\\r\\nsuggestions&mdash;all crutches, spring-boards, go-carts, tugs, patterns,\\r\\ntracings&mdash;and go his own way&mdash;and the Way of the Novel&mdash;with no guidance\\r\\nbut something of the example of Cervantes directly and Shakespeare\\r\\nindirectly among the moderns, and of the poetic fiction-writers of old.\\r\\nIt is perfectly clear that he had thought widely (and perhaps had read\\r\\nnot a little) on the subject of literary criticism, in a sense not\\r\\ncommon in his day, and that the thinking had led him to a conception of\\r\\nthe &quot;prose epic&quot; which, though it might have been partly (not wholly by\\r\\nany means) pieced out of the Italian and Spanish critics of the late\\r\\nsixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, had never been worked out as\\r\\na complete theory, much less applied in practice and to <a name=\"Page_106\" id=\"Page_106\" />prose. The\\r\\nProse Epic aims at&mdash;and in Fielding\\'s case has been generally admitted\\r\\nto have hit&mdash;something like the classical unity of main action. But it\\r\\nborrows from the romance-idea the liberty of a large accretion and\\r\\ndivagation of minor and accessory plot:&mdash;not the mere &quot;episode&quot; of the\\r\\nancients, but the true minor plot of Shakespeare. It assumes,\\r\\nnecessarily and once for all, the licence of tragi-comedy, in that sense\\r\\nof the term in which <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> and <i>A Winter\\'s Tale</i> are\\r\\ntragi-comedies, and in which <i>Othello</i> itself might have been made one.\\r\\nAnd it follows further in the wake of the Shakespearean drama by\\r\\ninsisting far more largely than ancient literature of any kind, and far\\r\\nmore than any modern up to its date except drama had done, on the\\r\\nimportance of Character. Description and dialogue are rather subordinate\\r\\nto these things than on a level with them&mdash;but they are still further\\r\\nworked out than before. And there is a new element&mdash;perhaps suggested by\\r\\nthe <i>parabasis</i> of ancient comedy, but, it may be, more directly by the\\r\\npeculiar method of Swift in <i>A Tale of a Tub</i>. At various places in his\\r\\nnarrative, but especially at the beginnings of books and chapters,\\r\\nFielding as it were &quot;calls a halt&quot; and addresses his readers on matters\\r\\nmore or less relevant to the story, but rather in the manner of a\\r\\ncommentator and scholiast upon it than as actual parts of it. Of this\\r\\nmore later: for the immediate purpose is to survey and not to criticise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The result of all this was <i>Tom Jones</i>&mdash;by practically universal consent\\r\\none of the capital books of English literature. It is unnecessary to\\r\\nrecapitulate the famous praises of Gibbon, of Coleridge, of Byron, and\\r\\nof others: and it is only necessary to deal briefly with the complaints\\r\\nwhich, if they have never found such monumental expres<a name=\"Page_107\" id=\"Page_107\" />sion as the\\r\\npraises, have been sometimes widely entertained. These objections&mdash;as\\r\\nregards interest&mdash;fasten partly on the address-digressions, partly on\\r\\nthe great inset-episode of &quot;The Man of the Hill:&quot; as regards morality on\\r\\na certain alleged looseness of principle in that respect throughout, and\\r\\nespecially on the licence of conduct accorded to the hero himself and\\r\\nthe almost entire absence of punishment for it. As for the first, &quot;The\\r\\nMan of the Hill&quot; was partly a concession to the fancy of the time for\\r\\nsuch things, partly a following of such actual examples as Fielding\\r\\nadmitted&mdash;for it need hardly be said that the inset-episode, of no or\\r\\nvery slight connection with the story, is common both in the ancients\\r\\nand in Cervantes, while it is to be found as long after Fielding as in\\r\\nthe early novel-work of Dickens. The digression-openings are at least as\\r\\nsatisfactory to some as they are unsatisfactory to others; it is even\\r\\ndoubtful whether they annoy anybody half so much as they have delighted\\r\\nsome excellent judges. The other point is well worn: but the wearing has\\r\\nnot taken off its awkwardness and unsavouriness. Difference of habit and\\r\\nmanners at the time will account for much: but the wiser apologists will\\r\\nsimply say that Fielding\\'s attitude to certain deviations from the\\r\\nstrict moral law was undoubtedly very indulgent, provided that such\\r\\ndeviations were unaccompanied by the graver and more detestable vices of\\r\\ncruelty, treachery, and fraud&mdash;that to vice which was accompanied by\\r\\nthese blacker crimes he was utterly merciless; and that if he is thus\\r\\nrather exposed to the charge of &quot;compounding by damning&quot;&mdash;in the famous\\r\\nphrase&mdash;the things that he damned admit of no excuse and those that he\\r\\ncompounded for have been leniently dealt with by all but the sternest\\r\\nmoralists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Such things are, however (in the admirable French sense),<a name=\"Page_108\" id=\"Page_108\" />\\r\\n<i>mis&egrave;res</i>&mdash;wretched petty cavils and shallows of criticism. The only\\r\\nsensible thing to do is to launch out with Fielding into that deep and\\r\\nopen sea of human character and fate which he dared so gloriously.\\r\\nDuring the curious phase of literary opinion which the last twenty years\\r\\nor so have seen, it has apparently been discovered by some people that\\r\\nhis scheme of human thought and feeling is too simple&mdash;&quot;toylike&quot; I think\\r\\nthey call it&mdash;in comparison with that, say, of Count Tolstoi or of Mr.\\r\\nMeredith, that modern practice has reached a finer technique than his or\\r\\neven than that of his greatest follower, Thackeray. Far be it from the\\r\\npresent writer to say, or to insinuate, anything disrespectful of the\\r\\ngreat moderns who have lately left us. Yet it may be said without the\\r\\nslightest disrespect to them that the unfavourable comparison is mainly\\r\\na revival of Johnson\\'s mistake as to Fielding and Richardson. It is,\\r\\nhowever, something more&mdash;for it comes also from a failure to estimate\\r\\naright the <i>parabasis</i>-openings which have been more than once referred\\r\\nto. These passages do not perhaps exhibit the by-work and the process in\\r\\nthe conspicuous skeleton-clock fashion which their critics admire and\\r\\ndesire, but they contain an amount of acute and profound exploration of\\r\\nhuman nature which it would be difficult to match and impossible to\\r\\nsurpass elsewhere: while the results of Fielding\\'s working, of his\\r\\n&quot;toylike&quot; scheme, are remarkable toys indeed&mdash;toys which, if we regard\\r\\nthem as such, must surely strike us as rather uncanny. One is sometimes\\r\\nconstrained to think that it is perhaps not much more difficult to make\\r\\nthan to recognise a thoroughly live character. It certainly must be very\\r\\ndifficult to do the latter if there is any considerable number of\\r\\npersons who are unable to do it in the case of almost every one of the\\r\\npersonages of <i>Tom Jones</i>. With <a name=\"Page_109\" id=\"Page_109\" />one possible exception they are all\\r\\nalive&mdash;even more so than those of <i>Joseph Andrews</i> and with a less\\r\\npeculiar and limited liveliness than those of <i>Jonathan Wild</i>. But it\\r\\ncertainly is curious that as the one good man of <i>Jonathan</i>, Heartfree,\\r\\nis the least alive of its personages, so the one bad man of <i>Tom</i>,\\r\\nBlifil, occupies the same position.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The result of this variety and abundance of life is an even more than\\r\\ncorresponding opportunity for enjoyment. This enjoyment may arise in\\r\\ndifferent persons from different sources. The much praised and seldom\\r\\ncavilled at unity and completeness of the story may appeal to some.\\r\\nThere are others who are inclined towards elaborate plots as Sam Weller\\r\\nwas to the &quot;\\'rig\\'nal&quot; of his subpoena. It was a &quot;gratifyin\\' sort o\\'\\r\\nthing, and eased his mind&quot; to be aware of its existence, and that was\\r\\nall. These latter find <i>their</i> sources of enjoyment elsewhere, but\\r\\neverywhere else. The abundance and the vividness of character-presentation;\\r\\nthe liveliness and the abundance of the staging of that character; the\\r\\nvariety of scene and incident&mdash;all most properly connected with the plot,\\r\\nbut capable of existing and of being felt without it; the human dialogue;\\r\\nthe admirable phrase in that dialogue and out of it, in the digressions, in\\r\\nthe narrative, above, and through, and about, and below it all&mdash;these\\r\\nthings and others (for it is practically impossible to exhaust the\\r\\ncatalogue) fill up the cup to the brim, and keep it full, for the\\r\\nborn lover of the special novel-pleasure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In one point only was Fielding a little unfortunate perhaps: and even\\r\\nhere the &quot;perhaps&quot; has to be underlined. He came just before the end of\\r\\na series of almost imperceptible changes in ordinary English speech\\r\\nwhich brought about something like a stationary state. His maligner and\\r\\nonly slightly younger contemporary, Horace Walpole, <a name=\"Page_110\" id=\"Page_110\" />in some of his\\r\\nletters, writes in a fashion which, putting mere slang aside, has hardly\\r\\nany difference from that of to-day. Fielding still uses &quot;hath&quot; for &quot;has&quot;\\r\\nand a few other things which seem archaic, not to students of literature\\r\\nbut to the general. In the same way dress, manners, etc., though much\\r\\nmore picturesque, were by that fact distinguished from those of almost\\r\\nthe whole nineteenth century and the twentieth as far as it has gone:\\r\\nwhile incidents were, even in ordinary life, still usual which have long\\r\\nceased to be so. In this way the immense advance&mdash;greater than was made\\r\\nby any one else till Miss Austen&mdash;that he made in the pure novel of this\\r\\nordinary life may be missed. But the intrinsic magnificence, interest,\\r\\nnature, abundance of <i>Tom Jones</i> can only be missed by those who were\\r\\npredestined to miss them. It is tempting&mdash;but the temptation must be\\r\\nresisted&mdash;to enliven these pages with an abstract of its astonishing\\r\\n&quot;biograph-panorama.&quot; But nothing save itself can do it justice. &quot;Take\\r\\nand read&quot; is the only wise advice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No such general agreement has been reached in respect of Fielding\\'s last\\r\\nnovel, <i>Amelia</i>. The author\\'s great adversary, Johnson&mdash;an adversary\\r\\nwhose hostility was due partly to generous and grateful personal\\r\\nrelations with Richardson, partly to political disagreement (for\\r\\nFielding was certainly &quot;a vile Whig&quot;), but most of all perhaps to a sort\\r\\nof horrified recoil from the novelist\\'s easy handling of temptations\\r\\nwhich were no easy matter to his critic&mdash;was nearly if not quite\\r\\npropitiated by it: and the enthusiasm for it of such a &quot;cynic&quot; as\\r\\nThackeray is well known. Of the very few persons whom it would not be\\r\\nridiculous to name with these, Scott&mdash;whose competence in criticising\\r\\nhis own art is one of the most wonderful though the least generally\\r\\nrecognised things about him&mdash;inclines, in the <a name=\"Page_111\" id=\"Page_111\" />interesting\\r\\nIntroduction-Dialogue to <i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i>, to put it on a level\\r\\nwith <i>Tom Jones</i> itself as a perfectly constructed novel. But modern\\r\\ncriticism has, rightly or wrongly, been more dubious. Amelia is almost\\r\\ntoo perfect: her very forgiveness (it has been suggested) would be more\\r\\ninteresting if she had not almost completely shut her eyes to there\\r\\nbeing anything to forgive. Her husband seems to us to prolong the\\r\\nirresponsibility of youth, which was pardonable in Tom, to a period of\\r\\nlife and to circumstances of enforced responsibility which make us\\r\\nrather decline to honour the drafts he draws; and he is also a little\\r\\nbit of a fool, which Tom, to do him justice, is not, though he is\\r\\nsomething of a scatterbrain. Dr. Harrison, whose alternate wrath and\\r\\nreconciliation supply the most important springs of the plot, is, though\\r\\na natural, a rather unreasonable person. The &quot;total impression&quot; has even\\r\\nbeen pronounced by some people to be a little dull. What there is of\\r\\ntruth in these criticisms and others (which it would be long even to\\r\\nsummarise) may perhaps be put briefly under two heads. It is never so\\r\\neasy to arouse interest in virtue as it is in vice: or in weak and\\r\\nwatered vice as in vice rectified (or <i>un</i>rectified) to full strength.\\r\\nAnd the old requirement of &quot;the quest&quot; is one which will hardly be\\r\\ndispensed with. Here (for we know perfectly well that Amelia\\'s virtue is\\r\\nin no danger) there is no quest, except that of the fortune which ought\\r\\nto be hers, which at last comes to her husband, and which we are told\\r\\n(and hope rather doubtfully) that husband had at last been taught&mdash;by\\r\\nthe Fool\\'s Tutor, Experience&mdash;not utterly to throw away. But this\\r\\nfortune drops in half casually at the last by a series of stage\\r\\naccidents, not ill-machined by any means, but not very particularly\\r\\ninteresting.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Such, however, are the criticisms which Fielding himself <a name=\"Page_112\" id=\"Page_112\" />has taught\\r\\npeople to make, by the very excellence of his success in the earlier\\r\\nnovels: and there is a certain comparative and relative validity in\\r\\nthem. But consider <i>Amelia</i> in itself, and they begin to look, if not\\r\\npositively unfounded, rather unimportant. Once more, the astonishing\\r\\ntruth and variety of scene and character make themselves felt&mdash;even more\\r\\nfelt&mdash;even felt in new directions. The opening prison scenes exceed\\r\\nanything earlier even in Fielding himself, much more in any one else, as\\r\\nexamples of the presentation of the unfamiliar. Miss Matthews&mdash;whom\\r\\nFielding has probably abstained from working out as much as he might\\r\\nlest she should, from the literary point of view, obscure Amelia&mdash;is a\\r\\nmarvellous outline; Colonels James and Bath are perfectly finished\\r\\nstudies of ordinary and extraordinary &quot;character&quot; in the stage sense. No\\r\\nnovel even of the author\\'s is fuller of <i>vignettes</i>&mdash;little pictures of\\r\\naction and behaviour, of manners and society, which are not in the least\\r\\nirrelevant to the general story, but on the contrary extra-illustrate\\r\\nand carry it out.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While, therefore, we must in no way recede from the position above\\r\\nadopted in regard to Richardson, we may quite consistently accord an\\r\\neven higher place to Fielding. He relieved the novel of the tyranny and\\r\\nconstraint of the Letter; he took it out of the rut of confinement to a\\r\\nsingle or a very limited class of subjects&mdash;for the themes of <i>Pamela</i>\\r\\nand <i>Clarissa</i> to a very large extent, of <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Grandison</i> to a\\r\\nconsiderable one, and of all three to an extent not small, are\\r\\npractically the same. He gave it altogether a larger, wider, higher,\\r\\ndeeper range. He infused in it (or restored to it) the refreshing and\\r\\npreserving element of humour. He peopled it with a great crowd of lively\\r\\nand interesting characters&mdash;endowed, almost without <a name=\"Page_113\" id=\"Page_113\" />regard to their\\r\\ntechnical &quot;position <i>in</i> life,&quot; with unlimited possession <i>of</i> life. He\\r\\nshook up its pillows, and bustled its business arrangements. He first\\r\\ngave it&mdash;for in matter of prose style Richardson has few resources, and\\r\\nthose rather respectable than transporting, and decidedly\\r\\nmonotonous&mdash;the attractions of pure literature in form, and in pretty\\r\\nvarious form. He also gave it the attraction of pure comedy, only\\r\\nlegitimately salted with farce, in such personages as Adams and\\r\\nPartridge; of lower and more farcical, but still admirable comedy in\\r\\nSlipslop and Trulliber and Squire Western; of comedy almost romantic and\\r\\ncertainly charming in Sophia; of domestic drama in Amelia; of satiric\\r\\nportraiture in a hundred figures from the cousins (respectable and\\r\\ndisreputable), Miss Western and Lady Bellaston, downwards. He stocked it\\r\\nwith infinite miscellanies of personage, and scene, and picture, and\\r\\nphrase. As has happened in one or two other cases, he carried, at least\\r\\nin the opinion of the present writer, the particular art as far as it\\r\\nwill go. He did not indeed leave nothing for his successors to do&mdash;on\\r\\nthe contrary he left them in a sense everything&mdash;for he showed how\\r\\neverything could be done. But if he has sometimes been equalled, he has\\r\\nnever been surpassed: and it is not easy to see even how he can be\\r\\nsurpassed. For as his greatest follower has it somewhere, though not of\\r\\nhim, &quot;You cannot beat the best, you know.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One point only remains, the handling of which may complete a treatment\\r\\nwhich is designedly kept down in detail. It has been hinted at already,\\r\\nperhaps more than once, but has not been brought out. This is the\\r\\nenormous range of suggestion in Fielding&mdash;the innumerable doors which\\r\\nstand open in his ample room, and lead from it to other chambers and\\r\\ncorridors of the endless palace of<a name=\"Page_114\" id=\"Page_114\" /> Novel-Romance. This had most\\r\\nemphatically not been the case with his predecessor: for Richardson,\\r\\nexcept in point of mere length, showed little power of expatiation, kept\\r\\nhimself very much to the same ground and round, and was not likely to\\r\\nteach anybody else to make excursions. Indeed Fielding\\'s breaking away\\r\\nin <i>Joseph Andrews</i> is an allegory in itself. But, at least with pupils\\r\\nand followers of any wits, there was not even any need of such breaking\\r\\naway from himself, though no doubt there are in existence many dull and\\r\\nslavish attempts to follow his work, especially <i>Tom Jones</i>. &quot;Find it\\r\\nout for yourself&quot;&mdash;the great English motto which in the day of England\\'s\\r\\nglory was the motto of her men of learning as well as of her men of\\r\\nbusiness, of her artists as well as of her craftsmen&mdash;might have been\\r\\nFielding\\'s: but he supplemented it with infinite finger-pointings\\r\\ntowards the various things that might be found out. Almost every kind of\\r\\nnovel exists&mdash;potentially&mdash;in his Four (the custom of leaving out\\r\\n<i>Jonathan Wild</i> should be wholly abrogated), though of course they do\\r\\nnot themselves illustrate or carry out at length many of the kinds that\\r\\nthey thus suggest.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And in fact it could not be otherwise: because, as has been pointed out,\\r\\nwhile Fielding had no inconsiderable command of the Book of Literature,\\r\\nhe turned over by day and night the larger, the more difficult, but\\r\\nstill the greater Book of Life. Not merely <i>quicquid agunt homines</i>, but\\r\\n<i>quicquid sentiunt, quicquid cogitant</i>, whatever they love and hate,\\r\\nwhatever they desire or decline&mdash;all these things are the subjects of\\r\\nhis own books: and the range of subject which they suggest to others is\\r\\nthus of necessity inexhaustible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If there have been some who denied or failed to recognise his greatness,\\r\\nit must be because he has played on these <a name=\"Page_115\" id=\"Page_115\" />unwary ones the same trick\\r\\nthat Garrick, in an immortal scene, played on his own Partridge. There\\r\\nis so little parade about Fielding (for even the opening addresses are\\r\\nnot parade to these good people: they may disconcert or even disgust,\\r\\nbut they do not dazzle them), that his characters and his scenes look\\r\\ncommonplace. They feel sure that &quot;if they had seen a ghost they would\\r\\nhave looked in the very same manner and done just as he does.&quot; They are\\r\\nsure that, in the scene with Gertrude, &quot;Lord, help them! any man&mdash;that\\r\\nis any good man&mdash;that had such a mother would have done exactly the\\r\\nsame.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Well! in a way no doubt they are right; and one may imitate the wisdom\\r\\nof Mr. Jones on the original occasion in not saying much more to them.\\r\\nTo others, of course, this is the very miracle of art&mdash;a miracle, as far\\r\\nas the art of prose fiction is concerned, achieved in its fullness for\\r\\npractically the first time. This is the true <i>mimesis</i>&mdash;the re-creation\\r\\nor fresh creation of fictitious reality. There were in Fielding\\'s time,\\r\\nand probably ever since have been, those who thought him &quot;low;&quot; there\\r\\nwere, even in his own time, and have been in varying, but on the whole\\r\\nrather increased, degree since, those who thought him immoral: there\\r\\nappear to be some who think (or would like it to be thought that they\\r\\nthink) him commonplace and obvious. Now, as it happens, all these\\r\\ncharges have been brought against Nature too. To embellish, and correct,\\r\\nand heighten, and extra-decorate her was not Fielding\\'s way: but to\\r\\nfollow, and to interpret, and to take up her own processes with results\\r\\nuncommonly like her own. That is his immense glory to all those who can\\r\\nrealise and understand it: and as for the others we must let them alone,\\r\\njoined to their own idols.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In passing to the third of this great quartette, we make <a name=\"Page_116\" id=\"Page_116\" />a little\\r\\ndescent, but not much of one, while the new peak to which we come is\\r\\nwell defined and separated, with characters and outlines all its own. It\\r\\nmay be doubted whether any competent critic not, like Scott, bribed by\\r\\ncompatriotism, ever put Smollett above Fielding, or even on a level with\\r\\nhim. Thackeray, in one of the most inspired moments of his rather\\r\\nirregularly-inspired criticism, remarks, &quot;I fancy he did not invent\\r\\nmuch,&quot; and this of itself would refer him to a lower class. The writer\\r\\nof fiction is not to refuse suggestion from his experience; on the\\r\\ncontrary, he will do so at his peril, and will hardly by any possibility\\r\\nescape shipwreck unless his line is the purely fantastic. But if he\\r\\nrelies solely, or too much, on such experience, though he may be quite\\r\\nsuccessful, his success will be subject to discount, bound to pay\\r\\nroyalty to experience itself. It is pretty certain that most of\\r\\nSmollett\\'s most successful things, from <i>Roderick Random</i> to <i>Humphry\\r\\nClinker</i>, and in those two capital books, perhaps, most of all, kept\\r\\nvery close to actual experience, and sometimes merely reported it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This, however, is only a comparative drawback; it is in a sense a\\r\\npositive merit; and it is connected, in a very intimate way, with the\\r\\ngeneral character of Smollett\\'s novel-method. This is, to a great\\r\\nextent, a reaction or relapse towards the picaresque style. Smollett may\\r\\nhave translated both Cervantes and Le Sage; he certainly translated the\\r\\nlatter: and it was Le Sage who in any case had the greatest influence\\r\\nover him. Now the picaresque method is not exactly untrue to ordinary\\r\\nlife: on the contrary, as we have seen, it was a powerful schoolmaster\\r\\nto bring the novel thereto. But it subjects the scenes of ordinary life\\r\\nto a peculiar process of sifting: and when it has got what it wants, it\\r\\nproceeds to heighten them and<a name=\"Page_117\" id=\"Page_117\" /> &quot;touch them up&quot; in its own peculiar\\r\\nmanner of decoration. This is Smollett\\'s method throughout, even in that\\r\\nsingular <i>pastiche</i> of <i>Don Quixote</i> itself, <i>Sir Launcelot Greaves</i>,\\r\\nwhich certainly was not his happiest conception, but which has had\\r\\nrather hard measure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As used by him it has singular merits, and communicates to at least\\r\\nthree of his five books (<i>The Adventures of an Atom</i> is deliberately\\r\\nexcluded as not really a novel at all) a certain &quot;liveliness&quot; which,\\r\\nthough it is not the life<i>like</i>ness of Fielding, is a great attraction.\\r\\nHe showed it first in <i>Roderick Random</i> (1748), which appeared a little\\r\\nbefore <i>Tom Jones</i>, and was actually taken by some as the work of the\\r\\nsame author. It would be not much more just to take Roderick as\\r\\nSmollett\\'s deliberate presentment of himself than to apply the same\\r\\nconstruction to Marryat\\'s not very dissimilar, but more unlucky, <i>coup\\r\\nd\\'essai</i> of <i>Frank Mildmay</i>. But it is certain that there was something,\\r\\nthough exactly how much has never been determined, of the author\\'s\\r\\nfamily history in the earliest part, a great deal of his experiences on\\r\\nboard ship in the middle, and probably not a little, though less, of his\\r\\nfortunes in Bath and London towards the end. As a single source of\\r\\ninterest and popularity, no doubt, the principal place must be given to\\r\\nthe naval part of the book. Important as the English navy had been, for\\r\\nnearly two centuries if not for much longer, it had never played any\\r\\ngreat part in literature, though it had furnished some caricatured and\\r\\nrather conventional sketches. There is something more in a play, <i>The\\r\\nFair Quaker of Deal</i>, by Charles Shadwell, nephew or son of Dryden\\'s\\r\\nvictim, but this was only of third or fourth rate literary value, and an\\r\\nisolated example to boot. The causes of the neglect have been set forth\\r\\nby many writers from Macaulay downwards, and need not be discussed here;\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_118\" id=\"Page_118\" />the fact is certain. Smollett\\'s employment of &quot;the service&quot; as a\\r\\nsubject may have been, consciously and intentionally, only one of those\\r\\nutilisings of personal experience of which we have spoken. But really it\\r\\nwas an instance of the great fact that the novelist, on the instigation\\r\\nmainly of Fielding himself, was beginning to take all actual life to be\\r\\nhis province.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smollett brought to his work peculiar powers, the chief of which was a\\r\\nvery remarkable one, and almost as much &quot;improved on&quot; Fielding as\\r\\nFielding\\'s exercise of it was improved on Richardson&mdash;that of providing\\r\\nhis characters and scenes with accessories. Roderick is not only a much\\r\\nmore disagreeable person than Tom, but he is much <i>less</i> of a person:\\r\\nand Strap, though (<i>vice vers&acirc;</i>) rather a better fellow than Partridge,\\r\\nis a much fainter and more washed-out character. But in mere interest of\\r\\nstory and accessories the journey of Roderick and Strap to London is\\r\\nquite the equal, and perhaps the superior, of that of Tom and his\\r\\nhanger-on after we once leave Upton, where the interest is of a kind\\r\\nthat Smollett could not reach. It is probable that Fielding might, if he\\r\\nhad chosen, have made the prison in <i>Amelia</i> as horribly and\\r\\ndisgustingly realistic (to use a horrible and disgusting word) as the\\r\\nship in <i>Roderick</i>, but he at any rate did not choose. Moreover\\r\\nSmollett, himself a member of one of the less predominant partners of\\r\\nthe British and Irish partnership, perhaps for that reason hit on\\r\\nutilising the difference of these partners (after a fashion which had\\r\\nnever been seen since Shakespeare) in the Welshman Morgan. As far as\\r\\nmere plot goes, he enters into no competition whatever with either\\r\\nFielding or Richardson: the picaresque model did not require that he\\r\\nshould. When Roderick has made use of his friends, knocked down his\\r\\nenemies, and generally elbowed and <a name=\"Page_119\" id=\"Page_119\" />shoved his way through the crowd of\\r\\nadventures long enough, Narcissa and her fortune are not so much the\\r\\nreward of his exertions as a stock and convenient method of putting an\\r\\nend to the account of them. The customer has been served with a\\r\\nsufficient amount of the commodity he demands: and the scissors are\\r\\napplied, the canister shut up, the tap turned off. It almost results&mdash;it\\r\\ncertainly coincides&mdash;that some of the minor characters, and some of the\\r\\nminor scenes, are much more vivid than the hero (the heroine is almost\\r\\nan absolute nonentity) and the whole story. The curate and the exciseman\\r\\nin the ninth chapter are, by common consent, among Smollett\\'s greatest\\r\\ntriumphs; but the curate might be excommunicated and the exciseman\\r\\nexcised without anybody who read the book perceiving the slightest gap\\r\\nor missing link, as far as the story is concerned.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smollett\\'s second venture, <i>Peregrine Pickle</i> (1751), was more\\r\\nambitious, perhaps rose higher in parts, but undoubtedly contained even\\r\\nmore doubtful and inferior matter. No one can justly blame him, though\\r\\nany one may most justly refrain from praising, from the general point of\\r\\nview, as regards the &quot;insets&quot; of Miss Williams\\'s story in <i>Roderick</i> and\\r\\nof that of Lady Vane here. From that point of view they range with the\\r\\n&quot;Man of the Hill&quot; in <i>Tom Jones</i>, and in the first case at least, though\\r\\nmost certainly not in the second, have more justification of connection\\r\\nwith the central story. He may so far underlie the charge of error of\\r\\njudgment, but nothing worse. Unluckily the &quot;Lady Vane&quot; insertion was, to\\r\\na practical certainty, a commercial not an artistic transaction: and\\r\\nboth here and elsewhere Smollett carried his already large licence to\\r\\nthe extent of something like positive pornography. He is in fact one of\\r\\nthe few writers of real eminence who have <a name=\"Page_120\" id=\"Page_120\" />been forced to Bowdlerise\\r\\nthemselves. Further, there would be more excuse for the most offensive\\r\\npart of <i>Peregrine</i> if it were not half plagiarism of the main\\r\\nsituations of <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Clarissa</i>: if Smollett had not deprived his\\r\\nhero of all the excuses which, even in the view of some of the most\\r\\nrespectable characters of <i>Pamela</i>, attached to the conduct of Mr. B.;\\r\\nand if he had not vulgarised Lovelace out of any possible attribution of\\r\\n&quot;regality,&quot; except of being what the time would have called King of the\\r\\nBlack Guard. As for Tom Jones, he does not come into comparison with\\r\\n&quot;Perry&quot; at all, and he would doubtless have been most willing and\\r\\nable&mdash;competent physically as well as morally&mdash;to administer the proper\\r\\npunishment to that young ruffian by drubbing him within an inch of his\\r\\nlife.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These, no doubt, are grave drawbacks: but the racy fun of the book\\r\\nalmost atones for them: and the exaltation of the naval element of\\r\\n<i>Roderick</i> which one finds here in Trunnion and Hatchway and Pipes\\r\\ncarries the balance quite to the other side. This is the case even\\r\\nwithout, but much more with, the taking into account of Smollett\\'s usual\\r\\nirregular and almost irrelevant <i>bonuses</i>, such as the dinner after the\\r\\nfashion of the ancients and the rest. No: <i>Peregrine Pickle</i> can never\\r\\nbe thrown to the wolves, even to the most respectable and moral of these\\r\\nanimals in the most imposing as well as ravening of attitudes. English\\r\\nLiterature cannot do without it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Without <i>Ferdinand Count Fathom</i> (1753) many people have thought that\\r\\nEnglish Literature could do perfectly well: and without going quite so\\r\\nfar, one may acknowledge that perhaps a shift could be made. The idea of\\r\\nre-transferring the method (in the first place at any rate) to foreign\\r\\nparts was not a bad one, and it may be observed that by <a name=\"Page_121\" id=\"Page_121\" />far the best\\r\\nportion of <i>Fathom</i> is thus occupied. Not a few of these opening\\r\\npassages are excellent: and Fathom\\'s mother, if not a person, is an\\r\\nexcellent type: it is probable that the writer knew the kind well. But\\r\\nhis unhappy tendency to enter for the same stakes as his great\\r\\nforerunners makes it almost impossible not to compare <i>Ferdinand Fathom</i>\\r\\nwith <i>Jonathan Wild</i>: and the effect is very damaging to the Count. Much\\r\\nof the book is dull: and Fathom\\'s conversation is (to adopt a cant word)\\r\\nextremely unconvincing. The fact seems to be that Smollett had run his\\r\\npicaresque vein dry, as far as it connected itself with mere rascality\\r\\nof various kinds, and he did well to close it. He had published three\\r\\nnovels in five years: he waited seven before his next, and then eleven\\r\\nmore before his last.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A qualified apology has been hinted above for <i>Sir Launcelot Greaves</i>.\\r\\nIt is undoubtedly evidence of the greatness of <i>Don Quixote</i> that there\\r\\nshould have been so many direct imitations of it by persons of genius\\r\\nand talent: but this particular instance is unfortunate to the verge of\\r\\nthe preposterous, if not over it. The eighteenth century was indeed\\r\\nalmost the capital time of English eccentricity: and it was also a time\\r\\nof licence which sometimes looked very like lawlessness. But its\\r\\neccentricities were not at this special period romantic: and its\\r\\nlawlessness was rather abuse of law than wholesale neglect of it. A\\r\\nrascally attorney or a stony-hearted creditor might inflict great\\r\\nhardship under the laws affecting money: and a brutal or tyrannical\\r\\nsquire might do the same under those affecting the tenure or the\\r\\nenjoyment of house or land. &quot;Persons of quality&quot; might go very far. But\\r\\neven a person of quality, if he took to riding about the country in\\r\\ncomplete steel, assaulting the lieges, and setting up a sort of\\r\\ncadi-<a name=\"Page_122\" id=\"Page_122\" />justice of his own in opposition to the king\\'s, would probably\\r\\nhave been brought pretty rapidly, if not to the recovery of his senses,\\r\\nto the loss of his liberty. Nor, with rare exceptions, are the\\r\\nsubordinate or incidental humours of the first class. But I have always\\r\\nthought that the opening passage more than entitles the book to an\\r\\nhonourable place in the history of English fiction. I do not know where\\r\\nto look, before it, for such an &quot;interior&quot;&mdash;such a complete Dutch\\r\\npicture of room and furniture and accessories generally. Even so learned\\r\\na critic as the late M. Bruneti&egrave;re thought that things of the kind were\\r\\nnot older than Balzac. I have known English readers, not ignorant, who\\r\\nthought they were scarcely older than Dickens. Dickens, however,\\r\\nundoubtedly took them from Smollett, of whom we know that he was an\\r\\nearly and enthusiastic admirer: and Scott, who has them much earlier\\r\\nthan Dickens, not improbably was in some degree indebted for them to his\\r\\ncountryman. At any rate in that countryman they are: and you will not\\r\\nfind a much better example of them anywhere than this of the\\r\\ninn-kitchen. But apart from it, and from a few other things of the same\\r\\nor similar kinds, there is little to be said for the book. The divine\\r\\nAurelia especially is almost more shadowy than the divine Narcissa and\\r\\nthe divine Emilia: and can claim no sort of sistership in personality\\r\\nwith Amelia or Sophia, even with Clarissa or Pamela. In fact, up to this\\r\\ntime Smollett\\'s women&mdash;save in the case of Fathom\\'s hell-cat of a\\r\\nmother, and one or two more who are &quot;minors&quot;&mdash;have done absolutely\\r\\nnothing for his books. It was to be quite otherwise in the last and\\r\\nbest, though even here the heroine <i>en titre</i> is hardly, even though we\\r\\nhave her own letters to body her out, more substantial than her elder\\r\\nsisters. But Lydia, though the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>, is <a name=\"Page_123\" id=\"Page_123\" />not the real heroine of\\r\\nthis book: her aunt and her aunt\\'s maid divide that position between\\r\\nthem.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A sufficiently ungracious critic may, if he chooses, see in Smollett\\'s\\r\\nfalling back on the letter-plan for <i>Humphry Clinker</i> (1771) an\\r\\nadditional proof of that deficiency in strictly inventive faculty which\\r\\nhas been noticed. The more generous &quot;judge by results&quot; will hardly care\\r\\nto consider so curiously in the case of such a masterpiece. For a\\r\\nmasterpiece it really is. The comparative absence of &quot;character&quot; in the\\r\\nhigher and literary sense as contrasted with &quot;character-<i>parts</i>&quot; in the\\r\\ntechnical meaning of the theatre has been admitted in the other books.\\r\\nHere, with the aid of the letters, it is amply supplied, or perhaps (to\\r\\nspeak with extreme critical closeness) the character-parts are turned\\r\\ninto characters by this means. There is no stint, because of the\\r\\nprovision of this higher interest, of the miscellaneous fun and\\r\\n&quot;business&quot; which Smollett had always supplied so lavishly out of his\\r\\nexperience, his observation, and, if not his invention, his combining\\r\\nfaculty. And there is the setting of interior and exterior &quot;furniture&quot;\\r\\nwhich has been also referred to. Abundant as is the information which\\r\\nthe eighteenth century has given us as to its justly beloved place of\\r\\npilgrimage, Bath, there is nothing livelier than the Bath scenes here,\\r\\nfrom Chesterfield to Miss Austen, and few things, if any, so vivid and\\r\\ndetailed. So it is with Clifton earlier, with London later, with\\r\\nScotland last of all, and with the journeys connecting them. Yet these\\r\\nthings are mere <i>hors d\\'oeuvre</i>, pickles, sauces, condiments, beside the\\r\\nsolid character-food of the Brambles and Melfords, of Winifred Jenkins\\r\\nand of the redoubtable Lismahago. That there is no exaggeration or\\r\\ncaricature cannot, of course, be said. It was not Smollett\\'s notion of\\r\\nart to present the <a name=\"Page_124\" id=\"Page_124\" />elaborate academies of Richardson, or the almost\\r\\nuncanny duplications of Nature which Fielding could achieve. He must\\r\\nembolden, in fact grotesque, the line; heighten, in fact splash and\\r\\nplaster, the colour. But he has not left Nature behind here: he has only\\r\\nput her in a higher light.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One means of doing so has been condemned in him, as in others, as in its\\r\\ngreat earlier master, Swift, and its greatest later one, Thackeray, by\\r\\nsome purists. They call it cheap and inartistic: but this is mere\\r\\npedantry and prudery. Mis-spelling is not a thing to be employed every\\r\\nday or for every purpose: if you do that, you get into the ineffably\\r\\ndreary monotony which distinguishes the common comic journalist. But\\r\\nthrown in occasionally, and in the proper place, it gives an excellent\\r\\nzest: and it has seldom been employed&mdash;never, except in the two\\r\\ninstances quoted&mdash;better than in the cases of Tabitha Bramble and her\\r\\nmaid. For it is employed in the only legitimate way, that of zest, not\\r\\nsubstance. Tabitha and Winifred would still be triumphs of\\r\\ncharacterisation of a certain kind if they wrote as correctly as Uncle\\r\\nMatthew or Nephew Jery. Further, Lismahago is a bolder and a much less\\r\\ncaricatured utilising of the &quot;national&quot; resource than Morgan. If\\r\\nSmollett had not been a perfectly undaunted, as well as a not very\\r\\namiable, person he would hardly have dared to &quot;<i>lacess</i> the thistle&quot; in\\r\\nthis fashion. But there are few sensible Scotsmen nowadays who would not\\r\\nagree with that most sensible, as well as greatest, of their\\r\\ncompatriots, Sir Walter Scott, in acknowledging the justice (comic\\r\\nemphasis granted) of the twitch, and the truth of the grip, at that\\r\\nformidable plant. The way in which Smollett mixes up actual living\\r\\npersons, by their own names, with his fictitious characters may strike\\r\\nus as odd: but there is, for the most part, nothing offensive in it,\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_125\" id=\"Page_125\" />and in fact, except a little of his apparently inevitable indulgence in\\r\\nnasty detail, there is nothing at all offensive in the book. The\\r\\ncontrast of its general tone with that especially of his first two; the\\r\\nsoftening and mellowing of the general presentation&mdash;is very remarkable\\r\\nin a man of undoubtedly not very gentle disposition who had long\\r\\nsuffered from extremely bad health, and whose chief original works\\r\\nrecently&mdash;the <i>Journey</i> and the <i>Adventures</i>&mdash;had been, the first a\\r\\ntissue of grumbles, the second an outburst of savagery. But though the\\r\\ngrumbles recur in Matthew Bramble\\'s mouth, they become merely humorous\\r\\nthere: and there is practically no savagery at all. Leghorn, it has been\\r\\nobserved more than once, was in a fashion a Land of Beulah: a &quot;season of\\r\\ncalm weather&quot; had set in for a rather stormy life just before the end.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Whatever may be his defects (and from the mere point of view of Momus\\r\\nprobably a larger number may be found in him than either in Richardson\\r\\nor in Fielding), Smollett well deserves an almost equal place with them\\r\\nin the history of the novel. Richardson, though he had found the\\r\\nuniversal as far as certain aspects of it in humanity are concerned, had\\r\\nconfined it within a very narrow space, or particular envelope, in tone\\r\\nand temper: the fact that he has been called &quot;stifling,&quot; though the\\r\\nepithet may not be entirely just, is almost sufficient evidence of this.\\r\\nFielding had taken the novel into a far larger air and, as has been said\\r\\nalready, there was hardly anything to which his method might not lead,\\r\\nand in which it would not be effective. But he had been exclusively\\r\\nEnglish in externals: and the result is that, to this day, he has had\\r\\nless influence abroad than perhaps any English writer of equal genius\\r\\nand than some of far less.<a id=\"footnotetag6\" name=\"footnotetag6\"></a><a href=\"#footnote6\"><sup>6</sup></a> Smollett, by his remark<a name=\"Page_126\" id=\"Page_126\" />able utilisation\\r\\nof the characteristics of the other members of Magna-Britannia; by his\\r\\nexcursions into foreign European and even transatlantic scenery, had\\r\\nwidened the external if not the internal prospect; and had done perhaps\\r\\neven more by that chance-medley, as it perhaps was, of attention to the\\r\\nstill more internal detail which was to be of such importance in the\\r\\nnovel to come. Taking the three together (not without due allowance for\\r\\nthe contemporary, if mainly imitative, developments which will be\\r\\ndescribed in the next chapter), they had put prose fiction in a position\\r\\nwhich it had not attained, even in Spain earlier, even in France at more\\r\\nor less the same time: and had entirely antiquated, on the one hand, the\\r\\nmere <i>fabliau</i> or <i>novella</i>&mdash;the story of a single limited situation&mdash;on\\r\\nthe other, the discursive romance with little plot and next to no\\r\\ncharacter. One great further development, impossible at this time, of\\r\\nthe larger novel, the historical, waited for Scott: but even this was\\r\\nsoon, though very awkwardly, tried. It could not yet be born because the\\r\\nhistoric sense which was its necessary begetter hardly existed, and\\r\\nbecause the provision of historic matter for this sense to work on was\\r\\nrather scanty. But it is scarcely extravagant to say that it is more\\r\\ndifficult to conceive even Scott doing what he did without Richardson,\\r\\nFielding, and Smollett before him, than it is to believe that, with\\r\\nthese predecessors, somebody like Scott was bound to come.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Great, however, as the three are, there is no need of any &quot;injustice to\\r\\nIreland&quot;&mdash;little as Ireland really has to claim in Sterne\\'s merit or\\r\\ndemerit. He is not a fifth wheel to the coach by any means: he is the\\r\\nfourth and almost the necessary one. In Richardson, Fielding, and\\r\\nSmollett the general character and possibilities of the novel had been\\r\\nshown, with the exception just noted: and indeed hardly <a name=\"Page_127\" id=\"Page_127\" />with that\\r\\nexception, because they showed the way clearly to it. But its almost\\r\\nillimitable particular capabilities remained unshown, or shown only in\\r\\nFielding\\'s half extraneous divagations, and in earlier things like the\\r\\nwork of Swift. Sterne took it up in the spirit of one who wished to\\r\\nexhibit these capabilities; and did exhibit them signally in more than\\r\\none or two ways. He showed how the novel could present, in refreshed\\r\\nform, the <i>fatrasie</i>, the pillar-to-post miscellany, of which Rabelais\\r\\nhad perhaps given the greatest example possible, but of which there were\\r\\nnumerous minor examples in French. He showed how it could be made, not\\r\\nmerely to present humorous situations, but to exhibit a special kind of\\r\\nhumour itself&mdash;to make the writer as it were the hero without his ever\\r\\nappearing as character in <i>Tristram</i>, or to humorise autobiography as in\\r\\nthe <i>Sentimental Journey</i>. And last of all (whether it was his greatest\\r\\nachievement or not is matter of opinion), he showed the novel of purpose\\r\\nin a form specially appealing to his contemporaries&mdash;the purpose being\\r\\nto exhibit, glorify, luxuriate in the exhibition of, sentiment or\\r\\n&quot;sensibility.&quot; In none of these things was he wholly original; though\\r\\nthe perpetual upbraiding of &quot;plagiarism&quot; is a little unintelligent.\\r\\nRabelais, not to mention others, had preceded him, and far excelled him,\\r\\nin the <i>fatrasie</i>; Swift in the humour-novel; two generations of\\r\\nFrenchmen and Frenchwomen in the &quot;sensibility&quot; kind. But he brought all\\r\\ntogether and adjusted the English novel, actually to them, potentially\\r\\nto much else.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To find fault with his two famous books is almost contemptibly easy. The\\r\\nplagiarism which, if not found out at once, was found out very soon, is\\r\\nthe least of these: in fact hardly a fault at all. The indecency, which\\r\\n<i>was</i> found out at once, and which drew a creditable and not in the\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_128\" id=\"Page_128\" />least Tartuffian protest from Warburton, is a far more serious\\r\\nmatter&mdash;not so much because of the licence in subject as because of the\\r\\nunwholesome and sniggering tone. The sentimentality is very often simply\\r\\nmaudlin, almost always tiresome <i>to us</i>, and in very, very few\\r\\ncases justified by brilliant success even in its own very doubtful\\r\\nkind. Most questionable of all, perhaps, is the merely mechanical\\r\\nmountebankery&mdash;the blanks, and the dashes, and the rows of stops, the\\r\\nblack pages and the marbled pages which he employs to force a guffaw\\r\\nfrom his readers. The abstinence from any central story in <i>Tristram</i> is\\r\\none of those dubious pieces of artifice which may possibly show the\\r\\nartist\\'s independence of the usual attractions of story-telling, but may\\r\\nalso suggest to the churlish the question whether his invention would\\r\\nhave supplied him with any story to tell; and the continual asides and\\r\\nhalts and parenthetic divagations in the <i>Journey</i> are not quite free\\r\\nfrom the same suggestion. In fact if you &quot;can see a church by daylight&quot;\\r\\nyou certainly want no piercing vision, and no artificial assistance of\\r\\nlight or lens, to discover the faults of this very unedifying churchman.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But he remains, for all that, a genius; and one of the great figures in\\r\\nour history. There is to his credit in general, as has been already\\r\\npointed out, the great asset of having indicated, and in two notable\\r\\ninstances patterned, the out-of-the-way novel&mdash;the novel eccentric,\\r\\nparticular, individual. There is to that credit still more the\\r\\nbrilliancy of the two specimens themselves in spite of their faults;\\r\\ntheir effectiveness in the literature of delight; the great powers of a\\r\\nkind more or less peculiar to the artist which they show, and the power,\\r\\nperhaps still greater, which they display in the actually general and\\r\\nordinary lines of the novel, though adapted to this extraordinary use.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_129\" id=\"Page_129\" />For though it pleased Sterne to anticipate the knife-grinder\\'s innocent\\r\\nconfession, &quot;Story? God bless you! I have none to tell, sir!&quot; in a\\r\\nsardonic paraphrase of half a score of volumes, he actually possessed\\r\\nthe narrative faculty in an extraordinary degree. He does not merely\\r\\nshow this in his famous inset short stories, accomplished as these are:\\r\\nhe achieves a much greater marvel in the way in which he makes his\\r\\n<i>fatrasies</i> as it were novels. After one or two, brief but certainly not\\r\\ntedious, volumes of the <i>Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy</i>, you know\\r\\nthat you are being cheated, and are going to be: at the end you know\\r\\nstill more certainly that you have been. You have had nothing of the\\r\\n&quot;Life&quot; but a great deal round rather than about the birth, and a few\\r\\nequivocal, merely glanced at, and utterly unco-ordinated incidents\\r\\nlater. If you have had any &quot;opinions&quot; they have been chiefly those of\\r\\nMr. Tristram Shandy\\'s father and other members of his family, or those\\r\\nof its friends and circle, or of those shadowy personages outside the\\r\\npretended story, such as Eugenius and Yorick, besides a few discourses\\r\\nwhich drop the slightest pretension of being Shandean or Tristramic and\\r\\nare plainly and simply the author\\'s. In the <i>Journey</i> there is more\\r\\nunity; but it is, quite frankly, the unity of the temperament of that\\r\\nauthor himself. The incidents&mdash;sentimental, whimsical, fie-fie&mdash;have no\\r\\nother connection or tendency than the fact that they occur to the\\r\\n&quot;gentleman in the black silk smalls&quot; and furnish him with figures as it\\r\\nwere for his performance. Yet you are <i>held</i> in a way in which nothing\\r\\nbut the romance or the novel ever does hold you. The thing is a\\r\\n&#956;&#965;&#952;&#959;&#987; &#7940;&#956;&#965;&#952;&#959;&#987;&mdash;story without story-end, without story-beginning,\\r\\nwithout story-connection or middle: but a story for all that. A\\r\\ndangerous precedent, perhaps; but a great accomplish<a name=\"Page_130\" id=\"Page_130\" />ment: and, even as\\r\\na precedent, the leader of a very remarkable company. In not a few\\r\\nnoteworthy later books&mdash;in a very much greater number of parts of later\\r\\nbooks&mdash;as we take our hats off to the success we are saluting not a new\\r\\nbut an old friend, and that friend Sterne.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the second great count&mdash;character&mdash;Sterne\\'s record is still more\\r\\ndistinguished: and here there is no legerdemain about the matter. There\\r\\nis a consensus of all sound opinion to the effect that my Uncle Toby is\\r\\nan absolute triumph&mdash;even among those who think that, as in the case of\\r\\nColonel Newcome later, it would have been possible to achieve that\\r\\ntriumph without letting his simplicity run so near to something less\\r\\nattractive. It is not the sentiment that is here to blame, because\\r\\nSterne has luckily not forgotten (as he has in the case of his dead\\r\\ndonkeys and his live Marias) that humour is the only thing that will\\r\\nkeep such sentiment from turning mawkish, if not even rancid; and that\\r\\nthe antiseptic effect will not be achieved by keeping your humour and\\r\\nyour sentiment in separate boxes. Trim is even better: he is indeed next\\r\\nto Sancho&mdash;and perhaps Sam Weller&mdash;the greatest of all &quot;followers&quot; in\\r\\nthe novel: he supplies the only class-figure in which Sterne perhaps\\r\\nbeats Fielding himself. About Walter Shandy there is more room for\\r\\ndifference: and it is possible to contend that, great as he is, he is\\r\\nnot complete&mdash;that he is something of a &quot;humour&quot; in the old one-sided\\r\\nand over-emphasised Jonsonian sense. Nothing that he does or says\\r\\nmisbecomes him: but a good deal that he does not do and say might be\\r\\nadded with advantage, in order to give us the portrait of a whole as\\r\\nwell as a live man. As for the other male characters, Sterne\\'s plan\\r\\nexcused him&mdash;as it did not quite in Mr. Shandy\\'s case&mdash;from making them\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_131\" id=\"Page_131\" />more than sketches and shadows. But what uncommonly lively sketches and\\r\\nshadows they are!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sterne\\'s unlucky failing prevented him in most cases from touching the\\r\\nwomen off with a clean brush: but the quality of <i>liveness</i> pertains to\\r\\nthem in almost a higher measure: and perhaps testifies even more\\r\\nstrongly to his almost uncanny faculty of communicating it by touches\\r\\nwhich are not always unclean and are sometimes slight to an astonishing\\r\\ndegree. Even that shadow of a shade &quot;My dear, dear Jenny&quot; has a\\r\\nsuggestion of verity about her which has shocked and fluttered some: the\\r\\nmaids of the Shandean household, the grisettes and peasant girls and\\r\\nladies of the <i>Journey</i>, have flesh which is not made of paper, and\\r\\nblood that is certainly not ink. And the peculiarity extends to his two\\r\\nchief named heroines, Mrs. Shandy and the Widow. Never were any two\\r\\nfemale personages more unceremoniously treated in the way of scanty and\\r\\nincidental appearance. Never were any personages of scanty and\\r\\nincidental appearance made more alive and more female.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>His details and accessories of all kinds, descriptive, literary, and\\r\\nother, would give subject for a separate chapter; but we must turn (for\\r\\nthis chapter is already too long) to his phrase&mdash;in dialogue, narrative,\\r\\nwhatever you please to call it. For the fact is that these two things,\\r\\nand all others in which phrase and expression can be used, melt into\\r\\neach other with Sterne in a manner as &quot;flibberti-gibbety&quot; as most other\\r\\nthings about him. This phrase or expression is of course artificial to\\r\\nthe highest degree: and it is to it that the reproach of depending on\\r\\nmechanical aids chiefly applies. And yet laboriously figured, tricked,\\r\\nmachined as it is&mdash;easy as once more it may be to prove that it is\\r\\nartifice and not art&mdash;the fact remains that, not <a name=\"Page_132\" id=\"Page_132\" />merely (perhaps not by\\r\\nany means chiefly) in the stock extract-pieces which everybody knows,\\r\\nbut almost everywhere, it is triumphant: and that English literature\\r\\nwould be seriously impoverished without it. Certainly never was there a\\r\\nstyle which more fully justified the definition given by Buffon, in\\r\\nSterne\\'s own time, of style as &quot;the <i>very</i> man.&quot; Falsetto, &quot;faking,&quot;\\r\\nvamping, shoddy&mdash;all manner of evil terms may be heaped upon it without\\r\\nthe possibility of completely clearing it from them. To some eyes it\\r\\nunderlies them most when it is most ambitious, as in the Le Fevre story\\r\\nand the diatribe against critics. It leaves the court with all manner of\\r\\nstains on its character. Only, once more, if it did not exist we should\\r\\nbe ignorant of more than one of the most remarkable possibilities of the\\r\\nEnglish language.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thus, in almost exactly the course of a technical generation&mdash;from the\\r\\nappearance of <i>Pamela</i> in 1740 to that of <i>Humphry Clinker</i> in 1771&mdash;the\\r\\nwain of the novel was solidly built, furnished with four main wheels to\\r\\nmove it, and set a-going to travel through the centuries. In a sense,\\r\\ninasmuch as <i>Humphry Clinker</i> itself, though Smollett\\'s best work, can\\r\\nhardly be said to show any absolutely new faculties, character, or\\r\\nmethod, the process was even accomplished in two-thirds of the time,\\r\\nbetween <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. We shall see in the next chapter\\r\\nhow eagerly the examples were taken up: and how, long before Smollett\\r\\ndied, the novel of this and that kind had become one of the most\\r\\nprolific branches of literature. But, for the moment, the important\\r\\nthing is to repeat that it had been thoroughly and finally started on\\r\\nits high road, in general by Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett; in\\r\\nparticular and wayward but promising side-paths by Sterne.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_IV\" id=\"CHAPTER_IV\" /><a name=\"Page_133\" id=\"Page_133\" />CHAPTER IV</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>THE MINOR AND LATER EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL<a id=\"footnotetag7\" name=\"footnotetag7\"></a><a href=\"#footnote7\"><sup>7</sup></a></h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is at last beginning to be recognised in principle, though it is\\r\\nstill much too often forgotten in practice, that the minor work of a\\r\\ntime is at least as important as the major in determining general\\r\\nliterary characteristics and tendencies. Nor is this anywhere much more\\r\\nnoticeable than in regard to the present period of our present subject.\\r\\nThe direct influence of Richardson and Fielding was no doubt very great:\\r\\nbut the development of the novel during the middle and later century was\\r\\ntoo large and too various to be all mere imitation. As a result,\\r\\nhowever, of their influence, there certainly came over the whole kind a\\r\\nvery remarkable change. Even before them the <i>nisus</i> towards it, which\\r\\nhas been noticed in the chapter before the last, is observable enough.\\r\\nMrs. Manley\\'s rather famous <i>New Atlantis</i> (1709) has at least the form\\r\\nof a key-novel of the political sort: but the whole interest is in the\\r\\nkey and not in the novel, though the choice of the form is something.\\r\\nAnd the second, third, and fourth decades of the century saw other work\\r\\ntestifying to the vague and almost unconscious hankering after prose\\r\\nfiction which was becoming endemic. A couple of examples of this may be\\r\\ntreated, in <a name=\"Page_134\" id=\"Page_134\" />passing, before we come to the work&mdash;not exactly of the\\r\\nfirst class in itself&mdash;of a writer who shows both the pre-Richardsonian\\r\\nand the post-Richardsonian phases of it most interestingly, and after a\\r\\nfashion to which there are few exact parallels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A book, which counts here from the time of its appearance, and from a\\r\\ncertain oddity and air of &quot;key&quot; about it, rather than from much merit as\\r\\nliterature, or any as a story, is the <i>Adventures of Gaudentio di Lucca</i>\\r\\nby Simon Berington.<a id=\"footnotetag8\" name=\"footnotetag8\"></a><a href=\"#footnote8\"><sup>8</sup></a> It appeared in 1737, between Defoe and Swift on\\r\\nthe earlier, and Richardson on the later side, while the English world\\r\\nwas to the novel as an infant crying for the light&mdash;and the bottle&mdash;at\\r\\nonce. It begins and ends with adventures and discoveries of an ordinary\\r\\nromantic type. But the body consists of a revelation to certain Italian\\r\\nInquisitors (who are not at all of the lurid type familiar to the\\r\\nProtestant imagination, but most equitable and well-disposed as well as\\r\\npotent, grave, and reverend signers) of an unknown country of &quot;the Grand\\r\\nPophar&quot; in the centre of Africa. This country is civilised, but not yet\\r\\nChristianised: and the description of it of course gives room for the\\r\\nexercise of the familiar game of contrast&mdash;in this case not so much\\r\\nsatiric as didactic&mdash;with countries nearer home which are at least\\r\\nsupposed to be both civilised and Christian. It is a &quot;respectable&quot; book\\r\\nboth in the French and the English sense: but it is certainly not very\\r\\namusing, and cannot even be called very interesting in any way, save\\r\\nhistorically.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The other example which we shall take is of even less intrinsic\\r\\nattraction: in fact it is a very poor thing. There are, however, more\\r\\nways than one in which<a name=\"Page_135\" id=\"Page_135\" /> <i>corpora vilia</i> are good for experiment and\\r\\nevidence: and we may find useful indications in the mere bookmaking of\\r\\nthe time. Lowndes, the fortunate publisher of <i>Evelina</i>, some dozen\\r\\nyears before that windfall came, had issued, or reissued, a collection\\r\\ncalled <i>The Novelist</i> and professedly containing <i>The select novels of\\r\\nDr. Croxall</i> [the ingenious author of <i>The Fair Circassian</i> and the part\\r\\ndestroyer of Hereford Cathedral] <i>and other Polite Tales</i>. The book is\\r\\nan unblushing if not an actually piratical compilation; sweeping\\r\\ntogether, with translations and adaptations published by Croxall himself\\r\\nat various times in the second quarter of the century and probably\\r\\nearlier, most of the short stories from the <i>Spectator</i> class of\\r\\nperiodical which had appeared during the past two-thirds of a century.\\r\\nMost of the rest are obvious (and very badly done) translations from the\\r\\nFrench and even from Cervantes\\' <i>Exemplary Novels</i>; seasoned with\\r\\npersonal and other anecdotes, so that the whole number of separate\\r\\narticles may exceed four-score. Of these a few are interesting attempts\\r\\nat the historical novel or novelette&mdash;short sketches of Mary Queen of\\r\\nScots (very sympathetic and evidently French in origin from the phrase\\r\\n&quot;a <i>temple</i> which was formerly a church&quot;), Jane Shore (an exquisitely\\r\\nabsurd piece of eighteenth-century middle-class modernising and\\r\\nmoralising), Essex, Buckingham, and other likely figures. There are cuts\\r\\nby the &quot;Van-somethings and Back-somethings&quot; of the time: and the whole,\\r\\nthough not worthy of anything better than the &quot;fourpenny box,&quot; is an\\r\\nevident symptom of popular taste. The sweetmeats or <i>hors d\\'oeuvre</i> of\\r\\nthe older caterings for that taste are here collected together to form a\\r\\n<i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>. It is true that <i>The Novelist</i> is only a true\\r\\ntitle in the older sense&mdash;that the pieces are <i>novelle</i> not &quot;novels&quot;\\r\\nproper. But they are fiction, or <a name=\"Page_136\" id=\"Page_136\" />fact treated like fiction: and though\\r\\nthe popular taste itself was evidently ceasing to be satisfied with\\r\\nthese morsels and demanding a substantial joint, yet the substance was,\\r\\nafter all, the same.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We rise higher, if not very high, with the novels of Mrs. Eliza Haywood\\r\\n(1693-1756), one of the damned of the <i>Dunciad</i>, but, like some of her\\r\\nfellows in that <i>Inferno</i>, by no means deserving hopeless reprobation.\\r\\nEvery one who has devoted any attention to the history of the novel, as\\r\\nwell as some who have merely considered it as a part of that of English\\r\\nliterature generally, has noticed the curious contrast between the\\r\\nearlier and the later novels of this writer. <i>Betsy Thoughtless</i> (1751)\\r\\nand <i>Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy</i> (1753) could, without much difficulty, be\\r\\ntransposed into novels of to-day. <i>Idalia</i> (1723) is of an entirely\\r\\ndifferent mood and scheme. It is a pure Behnesque <i>nouvelle</i>, merely\\r\\ndescribing the plots and outrage which ruin the heroine (<i>The\\r\\nUnfortunate Mistress</i> is the second title), but attempting no\\r\\ncharacter-drawing (the only hint at such a thing is that Idalia, instead\\r\\nof being a meek and suffering victim, is said to have a violent temper),\\r\\nand making not the slightest effort even to complete what story there\\r\\nis. For the thing breaks off with a sort of &quot;<i>perhaps</i> to be concluded\\r\\nin <i>some</i> next,&quot; about which we have not made up our minds. Very rarely\\r\\ndo we find such a curious combination or succession of styles so early:\\r\\nbut the novel, for pretty obvious reasons, seems to offer temptations to\\r\\nit and facilities for it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For <i>Idalia\\'s</i> above-named juniors, while not bad books to read for mere\\r\\namusement, have a very particular interest for the student of the\\r\\nhistory of the novel. Taken in connection with their author\\'s earlier\\r\\nwork, they illustrate, for the first time, a curious phenomenon which\\r\\nhas repeated itself often, notably in the case of Bulwer, and of <a name=\"Page_137\" id=\"Page_137\" />a\\r\\nliving novelist who need not be named. This is that the novel, more\\r\\nalmost than any other kind of literature, seems to lend itself to what\\r\\nmay be called the <i>timeserving</i> or &quot;opportunism&quot; of craftsmanship&mdash;to\\r\\ncall out the adaptiveness and versatility of the artist. <i>Betsy</i> and\\r\\n<i>Jenny</i> are so different from <i>Idalia</i> and her group that a critic of\\r\\nthe idle Separatist persuasion would, were it not for troublesome\\r\\ncertainties of fact, have no difficulty whatever in proving that they\\r\\nmust be by different authors. We know that they were <i>not</i>: and we know\\r\\nalso the reason of their dissimilarity&mdash;the fact that <i>Pamela</i> and her\\r\\nbrother and their groups <i>ont pass&eacute; par l&agrave;</i>.<a id=\"footnotetag9\" name=\"footnotetag9\"></a><a href=\"#footnote9\"><sup>9</sup></a> This fact is most\\r\\ninteresting: and it shows, among other things, that Mrs. Eliza Haywood\\r\\nwas a decidedly clever woman.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the same time the two books also show that she was not quite clever\\r\\nenough: and that she had not realised, as in fact hardly one of the\\r\\nminor novelists of this time did realise, the necessity of\\r\\nindividualising character. Betsy is both a nice and a good\\r\\ngirl&mdash;&quot;thoughtless&quot; up to specification, but no fool, perfectly\\r\\n&quot;straight&quot; though the reverse of prudish, generous, merry, lovable. But\\r\\nwith all these good qualities she is not quite a person. Jenny is, I\\r\\nthink, a little more of one, but still not quite&mdash;while the men and the\\r\\nother women are still less. Nor had Eliza mastered that practised knack\\r\\nof &quot;manners-painting&quot; which was to stand Fanny Burney, and many another\\r\\nafter her, in the stead of actual character-creation. Her situations are\\r\\noften very lively, if not exactly decorous; and they sometimes have a\\r\\nreal dramatic verisimilitude, for instance, the quarrel and\\r\\nreconciliation of the Lord and the Lady in <i>Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy</i>;\\r\\nbut the higher <a name=\"Page_138\" id=\"Page_138\" />verisimilitude of prose fiction they lack. Neither again\\r\\n(though Smollett had given her a lead here) had she attained that power\\r\\nof setting and furnishing a scene which is so powerful a weapon in the\\r\\nnovelist\\'s armoury. Yet she had learnt much: and her later work would\\r\\nhave been almost a wonder in her own earlier time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>She had even been preceded in the new line by one, and closely followed\\r\\nby another writer of her own sex, both of unblemished reputation, and\\r\\nperhaps her superiors in intellectual quality and accomplishment, though\\r\\nthey had less distinct novel-faculty. Sarah Fielding, the great\\r\\nnovelist\\'s sister, but herself one of Richardson\\'s literary seraglio,\\r\\nhad a good deal of her brother\\'s humour, but very little of his\\r\\nconstructive grasp of life. <i>David Simple</i> (1744), her best known work,\\r\\nthe <i>Familiar Letters</i> connected with it (to which Henry contributed),\\r\\nand <i>The Governess</i> display both the merit and the defect&mdash;but the\\r\\ndefect is more fatal to a novel than the merit is advantageous. Once\\r\\nmore&mdash;if the criticism has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> the occasions of\\r\\nit may be warranted to be much more nauseous in themselves&mdash;one looks up\\r\\nfor interest, and is not fed. &quot;The Adventures&quot; of David&mdash;whose progeny\\r\\nmust have been rapidly enriched and ennobled if Peter Simple was his\\r\\ndescendant&mdash;were &quot;in search of a Friend,&quot; and he came upon nobody in the\\r\\nleast like O\\'Brien. It was, in fact, too early or too late for a <i>lady</i>\\r\\nto write a thoroughly good novel. It had been possible in the days of\\r\\nMadeleine de Scud&egrave;ry, and it became possible in the days of Frances\\r\\nBurney: but for some time before, in the days of Sarah Fielding, it was\\r\\nonly possible in the ways of Afra and of Mrs. Haywood, who, without any\\r\\nunjust stigma on them, can hardly be said to fulfil the idea of\\r\\nladyhood, as no doubt Miss Fielding did.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_139\" id=\"Page_139\" />There is an amusing and (in its context) just passage of Thackeray\\'s,\\r\\nin which he calls Charlotte Lennox, author of <i>The Female Quixote</i>\\r\\n(1752), a &quot;figment.&quot; But it would be unlucky if any one were thereby\\r\\nprevented from reading this work of the lady whom Johnson admired, and\\r\\nfor whom he made an all-night orgie of apple-pie and bay-leaves. Her\\r\\nbook, which from its heroine is also called <i>Arabella</i>, is clever and\\r\\nnot unamusing, though it errs (in accordance with the moral-critical\\r\\nprinciples of the time) by not merely satirising the &quot;heroic&quot; romances\\r\\nof the Gomberville-La Calpren&egrave;de-Scud&egrave;ry type, but solemnly discussing\\r\\nthem. Arabella, the romance-bitten daughter of a marquis, is, for all\\r\\nher delusion, or because of it, rather a charming creature. Her lover\\r\\nGlanville, his Richardsonian sister, and the inevitable bad Baronet (he\\r\\ncan hardly be called wicked, especially for a Baronet) are more\\r\\ncommonplace: and the thing would have been better as a rather long\\r\\n<i>nouvelle</i> than as a far from short novel. It alternately comes quite\\r\\nclose to its original (as in the intended burning of Arabella\\'s books)\\r\\nand goes entirely away from it, and neither as an imitation nor\\r\\nindependently is it as good as Graves\\'s <i>Spiritual Quixote</i>: but it is\\r\\nvery far from contemptible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet though the aptitude of women for novel-writing was thus early\\r\\nexemplified, it is not to be supposed that the majority of persons who\\r\\nfelt the new influences were of that sex. By far the larger number of\\r\\nthose who crowded to follow the Four were, like them, men.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That not exactly credit to the Tory party, Dr. John Shebbeare, has had\\r\\nhis demerits in other ways excused to some extent on the score of\\r\\n<i>Lydia</i>&mdash;whose surname, by the way, was &quot;Fairchild,&quot; not unknown in\\r\\nlater days of fiction. Even one who, if critical conscience would in\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_140\" id=\"Page_140\" />any way permit it, would fain let the Tory dogs have a little the best\\r\\nof it, must, I fear, pronounce <i>Lydia</i> a very poor thing. Shebbeare, who\\r\\nwas a journalist, had the journalist faculty of &quot;letting everything go\\r\\nin&quot;&mdash;of taking as much as he could from Richardson, Fielding, Smollett,\\r\\netc., up to date (1755); and of throwing back to Afra for an interesting\\r\\nIndian, Canassatego. The book (like not a few other eighteenth-century\\r\\nnovels) has very elaborate chapter headings and very short chapters, so\\r\\nthat an immoral person can get up its matter pretty easily. A virtuous\\r\\none who reads it through will have to look to his virtue for reward. The\\r\\nirony is factitious and forced; the sentiment unappealing; the\\r\\ncoarseness quite destitute of Rabelaisian geniality; and the\\r\\nnomenclature may be sampled from &quot;the Countess of Liberal&quot; and &quot;Lord\\r\\nBeef.&quot; I believe Shebbeare was once pilloried for his politics. If it\\r\\nhad been for <i>Lydia</i>, I should not have protested.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The next book to be mentioned is an agreeable change. Why Hazlitt\\r\\ncompared <i>The Life of John Buncle</i> (1756-1766) to Rabelais is a somewhat\\r\\nidle though perhaps not quite unanswerable question; the importance of\\r\\nthe book itself in the history of the English novel, which has sometimes\\r\\nbeen doubted or passed over, is by no means small. Its author, Thomas\\r\\nAmory (1691?-1788), was growing old when he wrote it and even when he\\r\\nprefaced it with a kind of Introduction, the <i>Memoirs of several Ladies</i>\\r\\n(1755). It is a sort of dream-exaggeration of an autobiography; at first\\r\\nsight, and not at first sight only, the wildest of farragos. The author\\r\\nrepresents himself as a disinherited son who is devoted, with equal\\r\\nenthusiasm, to matrimony, eating and drinking as much as he can of the\\r\\nbest things he can find, discussion of theological problems in a\\r\\n&quot;Christian-deist&quot;<a name=\"Page_141\" id=\"Page_141\" /> or Unitarian sense, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; in the vague\\r\\neighteenth-century meaning, and rambling&mdash;chiefly in the fell district\\r\\nwhich includes the borders of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Westmoreland,\\r\\n&quot;Bishopric&quot; (Durham), and Cumberland. With this district&mdash;which even\\r\\nnow, though seamed with roads and railways, does actually contain some\\r\\nof the wildest scenery of the island; which only forty years ago was\\r\\nmuch wilder; and which in Amory\\'s time was a howling wilderness in\\r\\nparts&mdash;he deals in the characteristic spirit of exaggeration which\\r\\nperhaps, as much as anything else, suggested Rabelais to Hazlitt. From\\r\\nMalham Cove and Hardraw Scar, through the Wild Boar Fell district to the\\r\\nhead of Teesdale, you can find at this moment rough and rugged scenery\\r\\nenough, some of which is actually recognisable when &quot;reduced&quot; from\\r\\nAmory\\'s extravagance. But that extravagance extends the distances from\\r\\nfurlongs to leagues; deepens the caverns from yards to furlongs; and\\r\\nexalts fell and scar into Alps and Andes. In the same way he has to\\r\\nmarry eight wives (not seven as has been usually, and even by the\\r\\npresent writer, said), who are distractingly beautiful and wonderfully\\r\\nwise, but who seldom live more than two years: and has a large number of\\r\\nchildren about whom he says nothing, &quot;because he has not observed in\\r\\nthem anything worth speaking about.&quot; The courtships are varied between\\r\\nabrupt embraces soon after introduction, and discussions on Hebrew,\\r\\nBabel, &quot;Christian-deism,&quot; and the binomial theorem. In the most\\r\\ninhospitable deserts, his man or boy<a id=\"footnotetag10\" name=\"footnotetag10\"></a><a href=\"#footnote10\"><sup>10</sup></a> is invariably able to produce\\r\\nfrom his wallet &quot;ham, tongue, potted blackcock, and a pint of cyder,&quot;\\r\\nwhile in more favourable <a name=\"Page_142\" id=\"Page_142\" />circumstances Buncle takes his ease in his inn\\r\\nby consuming &quot;a pound of steak, a quart of green peas, two fine cuts of\\r\\nbread, a tankard of strong ale, and a pint of port&quot; and singing cheerful\\r\\nlove-ditties a few days after the death of an adored wife. He comes down\\r\\nthe side of precipices by a mysterious kind of pole-jumping&mdash;half a\\r\\ndozen fathoms at a drop with landing-places a yard wide&mdash;like a chamois\\r\\nor a rollicking Rocky Mountain ram. Every now and then he finds a\\r\\nskeleton, with a legend of instructive tenor, in a hermitage which he\\r\\nannexes: and almost infallibly, at the worst point of the wilderness,\\r\\nthere is an elegant country seat with an obliging old father and a\\r\\nlively heiress ready to take the place of the last removed charmer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mad, however, as this sketch may sound, and certainly not quite sane as\\r\\nAmory may have been, there is a very great deal of method in his, and\\r\\nsome in its, madness. The flashes of shrewdness and the blocks of pretty\\r\\nsolid learning (Rabelaisian again) do not perhaps so much concern us:\\r\\nbut the book, ultra-eccentric as it is, does count for something in the\\r\\nhistory of the English novel. Its descriptions, rendered through a\\r\\nmagnifying glass as they are, have considerable power; and are quite\\r\\nunlike anything in prose fiction, and most things in prose literature,\\r\\nbefore it. In Buncle himself there is a sort of extra-natural,\\r\\n&quot;four-dimension&quot; nature and proportion which assert the novelist\\'s power\\r\\nmemorably:&mdash;if a John Buncle could exist, he would very probably be like\\r\\nAmory\\'s John Buncle. Above all, the book (let it be remembered that it\\r\\ncame before <i>Tristram Shandy</i>) is almost the beginning of the Eccentric\\r\\nNovel&mdash;not of the satiric-marvellous type which Cyrano and Swift had\\r\\nrevived from Lucian, but of a new, a modern, and a very English variety.\\r\\nBuncle is sometimes extraordinarily like Borrow (on whom he prob<a name=\"Page_143\" id=\"Page_143\" />ably\\r\\nhad influence), and it would not be hard to arrange a very considerable\\r\\nspiritual succession for him, by no means deserving the uncomplimentary\\r\\nterms in which he dismisses his progeny in the flesh.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If there is an almost preposterous cheerfulness about <i>Buncle</i>, the\\r\\nnecessary alternative can be amply supplied by the next book to which we\\r\\ncome. The curious way in which Johnson almost invariably managed to hit\\r\\nthe critical nail on the head is well illustrated by his remark to\\r\\nFrances Sheridan, author of the <i>Memoirs of Miss Sydney Bid[d]ulph</i>\\r\\n(1761), that he &quot;did not know whether she had a right, on moral\\r\\nprinciples, to make her readers suffer so much.&quot; Substitute &quot;&aelig;sthetic&quot;\\r\\nfor &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;heroine&quot; for &quot;readers,&quot; and the remark retains its\\r\\ntruth on another scheme of criticism, which Johnson was not ostensibly\\r\\nemploying, and which he might have violently denounced. The book, though\\r\\nwith its subsequent prolongation too long, is a powerful one: and though\\r\\nactually dedicated to Richardson and no doubt consciously owing much to\\r\\nhis influence, practically clears off the debt by its own earnings. But\\r\\nMiss Bidulph (she started with only one <i>d</i>, but acquired another),\\r\\nwhose journal to her beloved Cecilia supplies the matter and method of\\r\\nthe novel, is too persistently unlucky and ill-treated, without the\\r\\nsmallest fault of her own, for anything but really, not fictitiously,\\r\\nreal life. Her misfortunes spring from obeying her mother (but there was\\r\\nneither moral nor satire in this then), and husbands, lovers, rivals,\\r\\nrelations, connections&mdash;everybody&mdash;conspire to afflict her. Poetical\\r\\njustice has been much abused in both senses of that verb: <i>Sydney\\r\\nBiddulph</i> shows cause for it in the very act of neglect.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But the eighteenth century, on the whole, loathed melancholy. The\\r\\n<i>Spiritual Quixote</i> (1772) of the Reverend<a name=\"Page_144\" id=\"Page_144\" /> Richard Graves (1715-1804)\\r\\nhas probably been a little injured by the ingenuous proclamation of\\r\\nindebtedness in the title. It is, however, an extremely clever and\\r\\namusing book: and one of the best of the many imitations of its\\r\\noriginal, which, indeed, it follows only on broad and practically\\r\\nindependent lines. During his long life (for more than half a century of\\r\\nwhich he was rector of Claverton near Bath) Graves knew many interesting\\r\\npersons, from Shenstone and Whitefield (with both of whom he was at\\r\\nPembroke College, Oxford, though he afterwards became a fellow of All\\r\\nSouls) to Malthus, who was a pupil of his; and he had some interesting\\r\\nprivate experiences. He wove a good deal that was personal into his\\r\\nnovel, which, as may easily be guessed, is a satire upon Methodism, and\\r\\nin which Whitefield is personally and not altogether favourably\\r\\nintroduced. But even on him Graves is by no means savage: while his\\r\\ntreatment of his hero, Geoffrey Wildgoose, a young Oxford man who,\\r\\nliving in retirement with his mother in the country, becomes an\\r\\nevangelist, very mainly from want of some more interesting occupation,\\r\\nis altogether good-humoured. Wildgoose promptly falls in love with a\\r\\nfascinating damsel-errant, Julia Townsend; and the various adventures,\\r\\nreligious, picaresque, and amatory, are embroiled and disembroiled with\\r\\nvery fair skill in character and fairer still in narrative. Nor is the\\r\\nSancho-Partridge of the piece, Jerry Tugwell, a cobbler (who thinks,\\r\\nthough he is very fond of his somewhat masterful wife, that a little\\r\\nabsence from her would not be unrefreshing), by any means a failure.\\r\\nBoth Scott and Dickens evidently knew Graves well,<a id=\"footnotetag11\" name=\"footnotetag11\"></a><a href=\"#footnote11\"><sup>11</sup></a> and knowledge of\\r\\nhim might with advantage be more general.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_145\" id=\"Page_145\" />The novels that have been noticed since those contrasted ones of Mrs.\\r\\nHaywood\\'s, which occupy a position by themselves, all possess a sort of\\r\\ntraditional fame; and cover (with the proper time allowed for the start\\r\\ngiven by Richardson and Fielding) nearly the same period of thirty\\r\\nyears&mdash;in this case 1744 (<i>David Simple</i>) to 1772 (<i>The Spiritual\\r\\nQuixote</i>)&mdash;which is covered by the novels of the great quartette\\r\\nthemselves. It would be possible to add a great many, and easy and not\\r\\ndisagreeable to the writer to dwell on a few. Of these few some are\\r\\nperhaps necessary. Frank Coventry\\'s <i>Pompey the Little</i>&mdash;an amusing\\r\\nsatirical novel with a pet dog for the title-giver and with the\\r\\npromising (but as a rule ill-handled) subject of university life treated\\r\\nearly&mdash;appeared in 1751&mdash;the same year which saw the much higher flight\\r\\n(the pun is in sense not words) of <i>Peter Wilkins</i>, by Robert Paltock of\\r\\nClement\\'s Inn, a person of whom practically nothing else is known. It\\r\\nwould be lucky for many people if they were thus singly yoked to\\r\\nhistory. It was once fashionable to dismiss <i>Peter</i> as a boy\\'s book,\\r\\nbecause it discovers a world of flying men and women, modelled partly on\\r\\nDefoe, partly on Swift; it has more recently been fashionable to hint a\\r\\nsneer at it as &quot;sentimental&quot; because of its presentment of a sort of\\r\\nfantastic and unconventional Amelia (who, it may be remembered, made her\\r\\nappearance in the same year) in the heroine Youwarkee. Persons who do\\r\\nnot care for fashion will perhaps sometimes agree that, though not\\r\\nexactly a masterpiece, it is rather a charming book. If anybody is\\r\\nsickened by its charm he may restore himself by a still better known\\r\\nstory which no one can accuse of <a name=\"Page_146\" id=\"Page_146\" />charm or sentiment, though it is\\r\\nclever enough&mdash;Charles Johnstone\\'s <i>Chrysal</i> or <i>The Adventures of a\\r\\nGuinea</i> (1760). This, which is strongly Smollettian in more ways than\\r\\none, derives its chief notoriety from the way in which the scandalous\\r\\n(and perhaps partly fabulous) orgies of Medmenham Abbey are, like other\\r\\nscandalous and partly fabulous gossip of the time, brought in. But it\\r\\n<i>is</i> clever; though emphatically one of the books which &quot;leave a bad\\r\\ntaste in the mouth.&quot; Indeed about this time the novel, which even in\\r\\nclean hands allowed itself not a little freedom, took, in others,\\r\\nexcursions in the direction of the province of &quot;prohibited literature,&quot;\\r\\nand sometimes passed the border.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One rather celebrated book, however, has not yet been mentioned: and it\\r\\nwill serve very well, with two others greater in every way, as usher to\\r\\na few general remarks on the weakness of this generation of minor\\r\\nnovelists. Between 1766 and 1770 Henry Brooke, an Irishman of position,\\r\\nfortune, and literary distinction in other ways, who was at the time of\\r\\nmore than middle age, published <i>The Fool of Quality</i> or <i>The Adventures\\r\\nof Henry Earl of Morland</i>. The hero is a sort of Grandison-Buncle, as\\r\\nproper though scarcely as priggish as the one, and as eccentric and\\r\\ndiscursive as the other; the story is chaos: the book is stuffed with\\r\\ndisquisitions on all sorts of moral, social, and political problems. It\\r\\nis excellently written; it is clear from it that Brooke (who was for a\\r\\ntime actually mad) did not belie the connection of great wits with\\r\\nmadness. But it is, perhaps, most valuable as an evidence of the\\r\\nunconquerable set of the time towards novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of this, however, as of some other points, we have greater evidence\\r\\nstill in the shape of two books, each of them, as nothing else yet\\r\\nmentioned in this chapter can claim <a name=\"Page_147\" id=\"Page_147\" />to be, a permanent and capital\\r\\ncontribution to English literature&mdash;Johnson\\'s <i>Rasselas</i> (1759) and\\r\\nGoldsmith\\'s <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> (1766).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is not from the present writer that any one need look for an attempt\\r\\nto belittle Johnson: and there is no doubt (for the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>\\r\\nis but a bundle of essays) that <i>Rasselas</i> is Johnson\\'s greatest <i>book</i>.\\r\\nBut there may be, in some minds, as little doubt that attempts to defend\\r\\nit from the charge of not being a novel are only instances of that not\\r\\nwholly unamiable frenzy of eagerness to &quot;say <i>not</i> ditto to Mr. Burke&quot;\\r\\nwhich is characteristic of clever undergraduates, and of periods which\\r\\nare not quite of the greatest in literature. <i>Rasselas</i> is simply an\\r\\nextended and glorified moral apologue&mdash;an enlarged &quot;Vision of Mirza.&quot; It\\r\\nhas no real story; it has no real characters; its dialogue is &quot;talking\\r\\nbook;&quot; it indulges in some but not much description. It is in fact a\\r\\nprose <i>Vanity of Human Wishes</i>, admirably if somewhat stiffly arranged\\r\\nin form, and as true to life as life itself. You will have difficulty in\\r\\nfinding a wiser book anywhere; but although it is quite true that a\\r\\nnovel need not be foolish, wisdom is certainly not its determining\\r\\n<i>differentia</i>. Yet for our purposes <i>Rasselas</i> is almost as valuable as\\r\\n<i>Tom Jones</i> itself: because it shows how imperative and wide-ranging was\\r\\nthe struggle towards production of this kind in prose. The book is\\r\\nreally&mdash;to adapt the quaint title of one of the preceding\\r\\ncentury&mdash;<i>Johnson al Mondo</i>: and at this time, when Johnson wanted to\\r\\ncommunicate his thoughts to the world in a popular form, we see that he\\r\\nchose the novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The lesson is not so glaringly obvious in the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>,\\r\\nbecause this <i>is</i> a novel, and a very delightful one. The only point\\r\\nof direct contact with <i>Rasselas</i> is the knowledge of human\\r\\nnature, though in the one book this <a name=\"Page_148\" id=\"Page_148\" />takes the form of melancholy\\r\\naphorism and apophthegm, in the other that of felicitous trait and\\r\\ndialogue-utterance. There is plenty of story, though this has not been\\r\\narranged so as to hit the taste of the martinet in &quot;fable;&quot; the book has\\r\\nendless character; the descriptions are Hogarth with less of <i>peuple</i>\\r\\nabout them; the dialogue is unsurpassable. Yet Goldsmith, untiring hack\\r\\nof genius as he was, wrote no other novel; evidently felt no particular\\r\\ncall or predilection for the style; would have been dramatist, poet,\\r\\nessayist with greater satisfaction to himself, though scarcely\\r\\n(satisfactory as he is in all these respects) to us. That he tried it at\\r\\nall can hardly be set down to anything else than the fact that the style\\r\\nwas popular: and his choice is one of the highest possible testimonies\\r\\nto the popularity of the style. Incidentally, of course, the <i>Vicar</i> has\\r\\nmore for us than this, because it indicates, as vividly as any of the\\r\\nwork of the great Four themselves, how high and various the capacities\\r\\nof the novel are&mdash;how in fact it can almost completely compete with and,\\r\\nfor a time, vanquish the drama on its own ground. Much of it, of\\r\\ncourse&mdash;the &quot;Fudge!&quot; scene between Mr. Burchell and the town ladies may\\r\\nbe taken as the first example that occurs&mdash;<i>is</i> drama, with all the\\r\\ncumbrous accessories of stage and scene and circumstance spared. One may\\r\\nalmost see that &quot;notice to quit,&quot; which (some will have it) has been,\\r\\nafter nearly a century and a half, served back again on the novel,\\r\\nserved by the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> on the drama.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the same time even the <i>Vicar</i>, though perhaps less than any other\\r\\nbook yet noticed in this chapter, illustrates the proposition to which\\r\\nwe have been leading up&mdash;that, outside the great quartette, and even to\\r\\na certain extent inside of it, the novel had not yet fully found its\\r\\nproper path&mdash;had still less made up its mind to walk freely and <a name=\"Page_149\" id=\"Page_149\" />firmly\\r\\ntherein. Either it has some <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>, some second purpose,\\r\\nbesides the simple attempt to interest and absorb by the artistic\\r\\nre-creation of real and ordinary life: or, without exactly doing this,\\r\\nit shows signs of mistrust and misgiving as to the sufficiency of such\\r\\nan appeal, and supplements it by the old tricks of the drama in\\r\\n&quot;revolution and discovery;&quot; by incident more or less out of the ordinary\\r\\ncourse; by satire, political, social, or personal; by philosophical\\r\\ndisquisition; by fantastic imagination&mdash;by this, that, and the other of\\r\\nthe fatal auxiliaries who always undo their unwise employers. Men want\\r\\nto write novels; and the public wants them to write novels; and supply\\r\\ndoes not fail desire and demand. There is a well-known <i>locus classicus</i>\\r\\nfrom which we know that, not long after the century had passed its\\r\\nmiddle, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Italy regularly received boxes of\\r\\nnovels from her daughter in England, and read them, eagerly though by no\\r\\nmeans uncritically, as became Fielding\\'s cousin and her ladyship\\'s self.\\r\\nBut while the kind had not conquered, and for a long time did not\\r\\nconquer, any high place in literature from the point of view of serious\\r\\ncriticism&mdash;while, now and long afterwards, novel-writing was the\\r\\nCinderella of the literary family, and novel-reading the inexhaustible\\r\\ntext for sermons on wasted, nay positively ill-spent, time&mdash;the\\r\\nnovelists themselves half justified their critics by frequent\\r\\nextravagance; by more frequent unreality; by undue licence pretty often;\\r\\nby digression and divagation still oftener. Except Fielding, hardly any\\r\\none had dared boldly to hold up the mirror to nature, and be content\\r\\nwith giving the reflection, in his own way, but with respect for it. For\\r\\neven Goldsmith, with infinite touches of nature, had not given quite a\\r\\nnatural whole, and even Johnson, though absolutely true, <a name=\"Page_150\" id=\"Page_150\" />had failed to\\r\\naccommodate his truth to the requirements of the novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The turning point in this direction of the kind was to be made by a\\r\\nperson far inferior in ability to any one of the great quartette, and in\\r\\na book which, <i>as</i> a book, cannot pretend to an equality with the worst\\r\\nof theirs&mdash;by a person indeed of less intellectual power, and in a book\\r\\nof less literary merit, than not a few of the persons and books just\\r\\nnoticed. There is something, no doubt, paradoxical in this: and the\\r\\nparadox is connected, both with a real quality of the subject and with a\\r\\nsurprising diversity of opinions about it. Frances Burney and her\\r\\n<i>Evelina</i> (1778), not to mention her subsequent works and her delightful\\r\\n<i>Diary</i>, have been the subject of a great deal of writing: but though\\r\\nmore than a hundred years&mdash;more indeed than a century and a\\r\\nquarter&mdash;have passed since the book insidiously took London by gradual\\r\\nstorm, it may, without too much presumption, be questioned whether\\r\\neither book or author has yet been finally or satisfactorily &quot;placed.&quot;\\r\\nThe immense advantage of not having a history, positively illustrated\\r\\nonce for all in Shakespeare, could hardly be negatively illustrated\\r\\nbetter than in Madame d\\'Arblay. She had the curious, and actually very\\r\\nunpleasant, experience of being selected for a position at court on the\\r\\nstrength of her literary achievements, of finding it intolerable, of\\r\\nbreaking down, and of never doing any really good work after her\\r\\nrelease, through much more than half of her long life. On this fact\\r\\ncritical biography has fastened almost exclusively. Macaulay, in one of\\r\\nhis most brilliant and best known essays, represents the world as having\\r\\nbeen deprived of unknown quantities of admirable work by the misplaced\\r\\nkindness, and the positive unkindness, of Queen Charlotte. Some have\\r\\nagreed with him, some have differed <a name=\"Page_151\" id=\"Page_151\" />with him. Some, in one of the\\r\\nnatural if uncritical revulsions, have questioned whether even <i>Evelina</i>\\r\\nis a very remarkable book. Some, with human respect for the great names\\r\\nof its early admirers, have passed it over gingerly&mdash;not exactly as\\r\\nwilling to wound, but as quite afraid or reluctant to strike. Nay,\\r\\nactual critical evaluations of the novel-values of Miss Burney\\'s four\\r\\nattempts in novel-writing are very rare. I dare say there are other\\r\\npeople who have read <i>The Wanderer</i> through: but I never met any one who\\r\\nhad done so except (to quote Rossetti) myself: and I could not bring\\r\\nmyself, even on this occasion, to read it again. I doubt whether very\\r\\nmany now living have read <i>Camilla</i>. Even <i>Cecilia</i> requires an effort,\\r\\nand does not repay that effort very well. Only <i>Evelina</i> itself is\\r\\nlegible and relegible&mdash;for reasons which will be given presently. Yet\\r\\n<i>Cecilia</i> was written shortly after <i>Evelina</i>, under the same stimulus\\r\\nof abundant and genial society, with no pressure except that of friendly\\r\\nencouragement and perhaps assistance, and long before the supposed\\r\\nblight of royal favour and royal exigences came upon its author. When\\r\\n<i>Camilla</i> was published she had been relieved from these exigences,\\r\\nthough not from that favour, for five years: and was a thoroughly happy\\r\\nwoman, rejoicing in husband and child. Even when the impossible\\r\\n<i>Wanderer</i> was concocted, she had had ample leisure, had as yet incurred\\r\\nnone of her later domestic sorrows, and was assured of lavish recompense\\r\\nfor her (it must be said) absolutely worthless labours. Why this steady\\r\\ndeclension, with which, considering the character of <i>Cecilia</i>, the\\r\\ncourt sojourn can have had nothing to do? And admitting it, why still\\r\\nuphold, as the present writer does uphold, <i>Evelina</i> as one of the\\r\\n<i>points de rep&egrave;re</i> of the English novel? Both questions shall be\\r\\nanswered in their order.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_152\" id=\"Page_152\" />Frances Burney must have been, as we see not merely from external\\r\\ntestimony, but from the infallible witness of her own diary, a most\\r\\nengaging person to any one who could get over her shyness and her\\r\\nprudery:<a id=\"footnotetag12\" name=\"footnotetag12\"></a><a href=\"#footnote12\"><sup>12</sup></a> but she was only in a very limited sense a gifted one.\\r\\nMacaulay grants her a &quot;fine understanding;&quot; but even his own article\\r\\ncontradicts the statement, which is merely one of his exaggerations for\\r\\nthe sake of point. She had <i>not</i> a fine understanding: though she was\\r\\nneither silly nor stupid, her sense was altogether inferior to her\\r\\nsensibility. Although living in a most bookish circle she was, as\\r\\nMacaulay himself admits, almost illiterate: and (which he does not say)\\r\\nher comparative critical estimates of books, when she does give them,\\r\\nare merely contemptible. This harsh statement could be freely\\r\\nsubstantiated: but it is enough to say that, when a girl, she preferred\\r\\nsome forgotten rubbish called <i>Henry and Frances</i> to the <i>Vicar of\\r\\nWakefield</i>: and that, when a woman, she deliberately offended\\r\\nChateaubriand by praising the <i>Itin&eacute;raire</i> rather than the <i>G&eacute;nie du\\r\\nChristianisme</i>, or <i>Atala</i>, or <i>Ren&eacute;</i>, or <i>Les Martyrs</i>. She had very\\r\\nlittle inventive power; her best novel, <i>Evelina</i>, has no plot worth\\r\\nspeaking of. She never wrote really well. Even the <i>Diary</i> derives its\\r\\nwhole charm from the matter and the <i>reportage. Evelina</i> is tolerable\\r\\nstyle of the kind that has no style; <i>Cecilia</i> is pompous and\\r\\nJohnsonian; <i>Camilla</i> was stigmatised by the competent and affectionate\\r\\njudgment of Mrs. Delany as &quot;Gallicised;&quot; and <i>The Wanderer</i> is in a\\r\\nlingo which suggests the translation of an ill-written French original\\r\\nby a person who does not know English.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_153\" id=\"Page_153\" />What then was it in <i>Evelina</i>, and in part in <i>Cecilia</i> (with a faint\\r\\nsurvival even into <i>Camilla</i>), which turned the heads of such a &quot;town&quot;\\r\\nas Johnson and Burke, Walpole and Windham, and many others&mdash;which, to\\r\\npersons who can see it, makes the books attractive to-day, and which\\r\\nshould always give their author a secure and distinguished place in the\\r\\ngreat torch-race of English fiction-writers? It is this&mdash;that Miss\\r\\nBurney had a quite marvellous faculty of taking impressions of actual\\r\\nspeech, manners, and to a certain extent character: that she had, at any\\r\\nrate for a time, a corresponding faculty of expressing, or at least\\r\\nreporting, her impressions. Next (and perhaps most of all) that she had\\r\\nthe luck to come at a moment when speech and manners were turning to the\\r\\nmodern; and lastly, that she was content, in parts of her work at any\\r\\nrate, to let her faculty of expression work, automatically and\\r\\nuninterfered with, on the impressions: and thereby give us record of\\r\\nthem for all time. Her acute critic &quot;Daddy&quot; Crisp lamented that we had\\r\\nnot had a series of recorders of successive <i>tons</i> [fashions] like\\r\\nFanny. But she was much more than a mere fashion-monger: and what has\\r\\nlasted best in her was not mere fashion. She could see and record life\\r\\nand nature: and she did so. Still, fashion had a good deal to do with\\r\\nit: and when her access to fashion and society ceased, the goodness of\\r\\nher work ceased likewise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even this gift, and this even in <i>Evelina</i> and the better parts of\\r\\n<i>Cecilia</i>, she had not always with her. The sentimental parts of\\r\\n<i>Evelina</i>&mdash;the correspondence with Mr. Villars, the courtship with Lord\\r\\nOrville, and others&mdash;are very weak: and it cannot be said that Evelina\\r\\nherself, though she is a pleasant girl enough, gives the lie to Mr.\\r\\nPope\\'s libel about women. Cecilia has a little more individuality. But\\r\\nthe great strength of the former book <a name=\"Page_154\" id=\"Page_154\" />lies in the admirable lower\\r\\nmiddle-class pictures of the Branghtons and Mr. Smith, whom Fanny had\\r\\nevidently studied from the life in the queer neighbourhood of Poland\\r\\nStreet: as also in the justness and verisimilitude of the picture of the\\r\\nsituation, which in different ways both books present&mdash;that of the\\r\\nintroduction of a young girl to the world.<a id=\"footnotetag13\" name=\"footnotetag13\"></a><a href=\"#footnote13\"><sup>13</sup></a> In these points, as in\\r\\nothers which there is neither space nor need to particularise, Miss\\r\\nBurney showed that she had hit upon&mdash;stumbled upon one may almost\\r\\nsay&mdash;the real principle and essence of the novel as distinguished from\\r\\nthe romance&mdash;its connection with actual ordinary life&mdash;life studied\\r\\nfreshly and directly &quot;<i>from</i> the life,&quot; and disguised and adulterated as\\r\\nlittle as possible by exceptional interests and incidents. It is\\r\\nscarcely too much to say that one great reason why the novel was so long\\r\\ncoming into existence was precisely this&mdash;that life and society so long\\r\\nremained subject to these exceptional interests and incidents. It is\\r\\nonly within the last century or so that the &quot;life of \\'mergency&quot; (to\\r\\nadapt Mr. Chucks slightly) ceased to be the ordinary life. Addison\\'s\\r\\n&quot;Dissenter\\'s Diary&quot; with its record of nothing but constitutionals and\\r\\nmarrow-bones, and Mr. Nisby\\'s opinions, has simply amused half a dozen\\r\\ngenerations. Yet, in a sense, it has nearly as much to do with the\\r\\nadvent of the novel as Sir Roger de Coverley himself. For these things\\r\\nare, not merely in an allegory, the subjects of the novel. Not so very\\r\\nmuch earlier Mr. Nisby would have had a chance of delivering his\\r\\nopinions on the scaffold: and his disciple would have had prison bread\\r\\nand water for marrow-bones and &quot;Brooks and Hellier.&quot; These would have\\r\\nbeen subjects for romance: the others were subjects for novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_155\" id=\"Page_155\" />All glory, therefore, be to Frances Burney; both that which her\\r\\ngenerous successor and superior gives her in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, and\\r\\nmore also&mdash;for Miss Austen, naturally enough, was not taking the\\r\\nview-point of literary history. But it has been said that Fanny herself\\r\\npossessed her gift in two senses uncertainly&mdash;first, in that she did not\\r\\nvery clearly perceive what it was, and, secondly, in that she soon lost\\r\\ngrip of it. It is, therefore, not wonderful that few others caught the\\r\\ntrick from her for a long time&mdash;for indeed fully twenty years, till Miss\\r\\nEdgeworth made her appearance. But these twenty years were years of\\r\\nextreme fertility in novels of different sorts, while&mdash;a phenomenon that\\r\\noccurs not seldom&mdash;the older kind of fiction made a kind of rally at the\\r\\nvery time that the newer was at last solidly establishing itself. There\\r\\nwas, indeed, ample room for both. You cannot kill Romance: it would be a\\r\\nprofound misfortune, perhaps the profoundest that could befall the human\\r\\nrace, if you could. But the new romance was of rather a bastard kind,\\r\\nand it showed more of the bad blood than of the good till, by a curious\\r\\ncoincidence, Scott once more found the true strain, just about the same\\r\\ntime as that at which Miss Austen was making known the true strain of\\r\\nthe novel proper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This hybrid new romance had been stumbled upon more than a decade before\\r\\nFanny Burney in her turn stumbled upon the pure novel: and most people\\r\\nknow in what and by whom. To this day it is by no means easy to be\\r\\ncertain what Horace Walpole really meant to write, or thought he was\\r\\nwriting, in <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> (1764). His own references to his\\r\\nown writings are too much saturated with affectation and pose to make it\\r\\nsafe to draw any conclusions from them; there is little or no external\\r\\nevidence; and the book itself is rather a puzzle.<a name=\"Page_156\" id=\"Page_156\" /> Taking the Preface to\\r\\nthe second edition with a very large allowance of salt&mdash;the success of\\r\\nthe first <i>before</i> this preface makes double salting advisable&mdash;and\\r\\naccommodating it to the actual facts, one finds it hardly necessary to\\r\\ngo beyond the obvious and almost commonplace solution that <i>The Castle\\r\\nof Otranto</i> was simply the castle of Strawberry Hill itself with paper\\r\\nfor lath and ink for plaster&mdash;in other words, an effort to imitate\\r\\nsomething which the imitator more than half misunderstood. Of medi&aelig;val\\r\\nliterature proper, apart from chronicles and genealogies, Walpole knew\\r\\nnothing: and for its more precious features he had the dislike which\\r\\nsometimes accompanies ignorance. But he undoubtedly had positive\\r\\nliterary genius&mdash;flawed, alloyed, incomplete, uncritical of itself, but\\r\\nexisting: and this genius showed itself here. His paper-and-ink\\r\\n&quot;Strawberry&quot; is quite another guess structure from his lath-and-plaster\\r\\none. For itself in itself&mdash;for what it <i>is</i>&mdash;the present writer, though\\r\\nhe has striven earnestly and often for the sake of the great things that\\r\\nit <i>did</i>, has never been able to get up any affection or admiration. It\\r\\nis preposterous, desultory, tedious, clumsy, dull. But it made people\\r\\n(we know it on such excellent authority as Gray\\'s) shudder: and the\\r\\nshudder was exactly what they wanted&mdash;in every sense of the verb &quot;to\\r\\nwant.&quot; Moreover, quite independently of this shudder, it pointed the way\\r\\nto a wide, fertile, and delightful province of historical, social,\\r\\nliterary, and other matter which had long been neglected, and which\\r\\npeople had been assured was not worth exploring. Blair was just using,\\r\\nor about to use, &quot;any romance of chivalry&quot; as a hyperbolical\\r\\nexemplification of the contemptible in literature. Hume had been arguing\\r\\nagainst, and Voltaire was still sneering at, all sorts of superstition\\r\\nand supernaturalism. The common cant <a name=\"Page_157\" id=\"Page_157\" />of criticism for generations had\\r\\nbeen that &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;reason&quot; were to be the only criteria. Walpole\\'s\\r\\negregious helmet dropped from no one knew (or knows) where on all these\\r\\nPhilistinisms: and squelched them. How it did this, why it did it, and\\r\\nso forth, one knows not much more than one knows why and how all the\\r\\nthings happened in the novel itself. <i>Apr&egrave;s coup</i>, the author talked\\r\\nabout &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (of whom, by the way, he was anything but a fervent\\r\\nor thorough admirer) and the like. Shakespeare had, as Sir Walter\\r\\nRaleigh has well pointed out, uncommonly little to do with it. But\\r\\nShakespeare at least supplies us with an appropriate phrase for the\\r\\noccasion. <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> &quot;lay in&quot; Horace\\'s &quot;way, and he found\\r\\nit.&quot; And with it, though hardly in it, he found the New Romance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In Horace\\'s case also, as in that of Frances, though the success was\\r\\neven more momentous, the successors were slow and doubtful, though not\\r\\nquite so slow. In some dozen years Walpole read Miss Clara Reeve\\'s <i>Old\\r\\nEnglish Baron</i> (1777), and as in another celebrated case &quot;thought it a\\r\\nbore.&quot; It <i>is</i> rather a bore. It has more consecutiveness than\\r\\n<i>Otranto</i>, and escapes the absurdities of the copiously but clumsily\\r\\nused supernatural by administering it in a very minute dose. But there\\r\\nis not a spark of genius in it, whereas that spark, though sometimes\\r\\ncuriously wrapped up in ashes, was always present (Heaven knows where he\\r\\ngot it!) in Sir Robert\\'s youngest son. And the contagion spread. For\\r\\ngeneral and epidemic purposes it had to wait till the Germans had\\r\\ncarried it over the North Sea and sent it back again. For particular\\r\\nones, it found a new development in one of the most remarkable of all\\r\\nnovels, twenty years younger than <i>Otranto</i>, and a few years older than\\r\\nthe new outburst of the &quot;Gothic&quot;<a name=\"Page_158\" id=\"Page_158\" /> supernatural in the works of Anne\\r\\nRadcliffe and Mat Lewis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Vathek</i> (1786) stands alone&mdash;almost independent even of its\\r\\nsponsors&mdash;it would be awkward to say godfathers&mdash;Hamilton and Voltaire;\\r\\napart likewise from such work as it, no doubt, in turn partly suggested\\r\\nto Peacock and to Disraeli. There is, perhaps, no one towards whom it is\\r\\nso tempting to play the idle game of retrospective Providence as towards\\r\\nthe describer of Batalha and Alcoba&ccedil;a, the creator of Nouronnihar and\\r\\nthe Hall of Eblis. Fonthill has had too many vicissitudes since\\r\\nBeckford, and Cintra is a far cry; but though his associations with Bath\\r\\nare later, it is still possible, in that oddly enchanted city, to get\\r\\nsomething of the mixed atmosphere&mdash;eighteenth century, nineteenth, and\\r\\nof centuries older and younger than either&mdash;which, <i>tamis&eacute;e</i> in a\\r\\nmysterious fashion, surrounds this extraordinary little masterpiece.\\r\\nTake Beckford\\'s millions away; make him coin his wits to supply the want\\r\\nof them; and what would have been the result? Perhaps more <i>Vatheks</i>;\\r\\nperhaps things even better than <i>Vathek</i>;<a id=\"footnotetag14\" name=\"footnotetag14\"></a><a href=\"#footnote14\"><sup>14</sup></a> perhaps nothing at all. On\\r\\nthe whole, it is always wiser not to play Providence, in fact or fancy.\\r\\nAll that need be said is that Anthony Hamilton and Voltaire are\\r\\ncertainly not by themselves&mdash;good as they are, and admirable as the\\r\\nfirst is&mdash;enough to account for <i>Vathek</i>. Romance has passed there as\\r\\nwell as persiflage and something like <i>co&iuml;onnerie</i>; it is Romance that\\r\\nhas given us the baleful beauty of that Queen of Evil, Nouronnihar, and\\r\\nthe vision of the burning hearts that make their own wandering but\\r\\neternal Hell. The tendency of the novel had been on the <a name=\"Page_159\" id=\"Page_159\" />whole, even in\\r\\nits best examples, to prose in feeling as well as in form. It was\\r\\nBeckford who availed himself of the poetry which is almost inseparable\\r\\nfrom Romance. But it was Horace Walpole who had opened the door to\\r\\nRomance herself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Still, <i>Vatheks</i> are not to be had to order: and as Romance was wanted,\\r\\nto order and in bulk, during the late years of the eighteenth century,\\r\\nsome other kind had to be supplied. The chief accredited purveyors of it\\r\\nhave been already named and must now be dealt with, to be followed by\\r\\nthe list of secondary, never quite accomplished, exponents now of novel,\\r\\nnow of romance, now of the two mixed, who filled the closing years of\\r\\nthe eighteenth century.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is, however, unjust to put the author of <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>\\r\\nand the author of <i>The Monk</i> on the same level. Mat Lewis was a clever\\r\\nboy with a lively fancy, a knack of catching and even of anticipating\\r\\npopular tendencies in literature, a rather vulgar taste by nature, and\\r\\nno faculty of self-criticism to correct it. The famous <i>Monk</i> (1795),\\r\\nwhich he published when he was twenty, is as preposterous as <i>Otranto</i>\\r\\nand adds to its preposterousness a <i>haut go&ucirc;t</i> of atrocity and indecency\\r\\nwhich Walpole was far too much of a gentleman, and even of a true man of\\r\\nletters, to attempt or to tolerate. Lewis\\'s other work in various forms\\r\\nis less offensive: but&mdash;except in respect of verse-rhythm which does not\\r\\nhere concern us&mdash;hardly any of it is literature. What does concern us is\\r\\nthat the time took it for literature, because it adopted the\\r\\nterror-style in fiction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Anne Ward (she married a barrister named Radcliffe, of whom we do not\\r\\nhear much except that his engagements in journalism threw time on his\\r\\nwife\\'s hands for writing) appears to have started on her career of\\r\\nterror-novelist, in which she preceded Lewis, with two fixed resolves of\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_160\" id=\"Page_160\" />principle very contrary to his practice. The first was to observe\\r\\nstrict &quot;propriety&quot; in her books&mdash;a point in which the novel had always\\r\\nbeen a little peccant. The second and more questionable, but also more\\r\\noriginal, was a curious determination to lavish the appearance of the\\r\\nsupernatural, in accordance with the Walpolian tradition and the German\\r\\nadoption of it, but never to allow anything <i>really</i> supernatural in\\r\\nultimate explanation or want of explanation. She applied these two\\r\\nprinciples to the working out, over and over again, of practically the\\r\\nsame story&mdash;the persecutions of a beautiful and virtuous heroine, and\\r\\nher final deliverance from them. Her first attempt, <i>The Castles of\\r\\nAthlin and Dunbayne</i>, appeared as early as 1789: and she left a\\r\\nposthumous romance, <i>Gaston de Blondeville</i>, which did not come out till\\r\\n1826, four years after her death. She also wrote some poems and a volume\\r\\nof <i>Travels</i> (1794) which is important for a reason to be noticed\\r\\npresently. But her fame rests upon four books, which she published in\\r\\nseven years, between her own twenty-sixth and thirty-third, <i>A Sicilian\\r\\nRomance</i> (1790), <i>The Romance of the Forest</i> (1791), the world-renowned\\r\\n<i>Mysteries of Udolpho</i> in 1794-1795, and <i>The Italian</i> two years later.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These stories owed their original attraction to the skill with which, by\\r\\nthe use of a Defoe-like minuteness of detail, added to a pictorial\\r\\nfaculty which Defoe had not, an atmosphere of terror is constantly\\r\\ndiffused and kept up. Very little that is terrible actually happens: but\\r\\nthe artist succeeds (so long as the trick has not become too familiar)\\r\\nin persuading you that something very terrible is <i>going</i> to happen, or\\r\\nhas just happened. And so the delight of something &quot;horrid,&quot; as the\\r\\nCatherines and Isabellas of the day put it, is given much more\\r\\nplentifully, and even <a name=\"Page_161\" id=\"Page_161\" />much more excitingly, than it could be by a real\\r\\nhorror now and then, with intervals of miscellaneous business. In one\\r\\nsense, indeed, the process will not stand even the slightest critical\\r\\nexamination: for it is soon seen to consist of a succession of serious\\r\\nmystifications and non-comic much-ados-about-nothing. But these &quot;ados&quot;\\r\\nare most cunningly made (her last book, <i>The Italian</i>, is, perhaps, the\\r\\nbest place to look for them, if the reader is not taking up the whole\\r\\nsubject with a virtuous thoroughness), and Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s great praise\\r\\nis that she induced her original readers to suspend their critical\\r\\nfaculties sufficiently to enable them to take it all seriously. Scott,\\r\\nwho undoubtedly owed her something, assigned her positive genius: and\\r\\nmodern critics, while, perhaps, seldom experiencing much real\\r\\ndelectation from her work, have discovered in it not a few positive and\\r\\nmany more indirect and comparative merits. The influence on Scott is not\\r\\nthe least of these: but there is even a more unquestionable asset of the\\r\\nsame kind in the fact that the Byronic villain-hero, if not Byron\\r\\nhimself, is Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s work. Schedoni did much more than beget or\\r\\npattern Lara: he <i>is</i> Lara, to all intents and purposes, in &quot;first\\r\\nstate&quot; and before the final touch has been put by the greater master who\\r\\ntook the plate in hand.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But there is more to be said for Mrs. Radcliffe than this. Her\\r\\n&quot;explained supernatural,&quot; tiresome as it may be to some of us nowadays,\\r\\nis really a marvel of patience and ingenuity: and this same quality\\r\\nextends to her plots generally. The historical side of her novels (which\\r\\nshe does to some extent attempt) is a failure, as everything of the kind\\r\\nwas before Scott: that we may leave till we come to Scott himself. But\\r\\none important engine of the novelist she set to work in a fashion which\\r\\nhad never been <a name=\"Page_162\" id=\"Page_162\" />managed before, and that is elaborate description. She\\r\\nshows an early adaptation of that &quot;picturesque,&quot; of which we see the\\r\\nbeginnings in Gray, when she was in the nursery, which was being\\r\\ndirectly developed by Gilpin, but which, as we may see from her\\r\\n<i>Travels</i>, she had got not merely from books, but from her own\\r\\nobservation. She applies it both within and without: at one moment\\r\\ngiving pages on the scenery of the Apennines, at another paragraphs on\\r\\nthe furniture of her abbeys and castles. The pine forests and the\\r\\ncataracts; the skyline of Udolpho bathed in sunset glow, while a\\r\\n&quot;melancholy purple tint&quot; steals up the slopes to its foundations&mdash;are\\r\\nall in the day\\'s work now; but they were not so then, and it is fair to\\r\\nsay that Mrs. Radcliffe does them well. The &quot;high canopied tester of\\r\\ndark green damask&quot; and the &quot;counterpane of black velvet&quot; which\\r\\nillustrate the introduction of the famous chapter of the Black Pall in\\r\\nChateau le Blanc may be mere inventory goods now: but, once more, they\\r\\nwere not so then. And this faculty of description (which, as noted\\r\\nabove, could hardly have been, and pretty certainly was not, got from\\r\\nbooks, though it may have been, to some extent and quite legitimately,\\r\\ngot from pictures) was applied in many minor ways&mdash;touches of really or\\r\\nsupposedly horrible objects in the dark, faint suggestions of sound, or\\r\\nof appeals to the other senses&mdash;hints of all sorts, which were to become\\r\\ncommon tricks of the trade, but were then quite new.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At any rate, by these and other means she attained that great result of\\r\\nthe novel which has been noted in Defoe, in Richardson, and in\\r\\nothers&mdash;the result of what the French vividly call <i>enfisting</i> the\\r\\nreader&mdash;getting hold of his attention, absorbing him in a pleasant\\r\\nfashion. The mechanism was often too mechanical: taken with the\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_163\" id=\"Page_163\" />author\\'s steady and honest, but somewhat inartistic determination to\\r\\nexplain everything it sometimes produces effects positively ridiculous\\r\\nto us. With the proviso of <i>valeat quantum</i>, it is not quite unfair to\\r\\ndwell, as has often been dwelt, on the fact that the grand triumph of\\r\\nMrs. Radcliffe\\'s terrormongering&mdash;the famous incident of the Black\\r\\nVeil&mdash;is produced by a piece of wax-work. But the result resulted&mdash;the\\r\\neffect <i>was</i> produced: and it was left to those who were clever enough\\r\\nto improve upon the means. For the time these means were &quot;improved upon&quot;\\r\\nin another sense; we shall glance at some of the caricatures, intended\\r\\nand unintended, later. For the present we may turn to other varieties of\\r\\nthe curiously swarming novel-production of these two last decades of the\\r\\ncentury, and especially of the very last.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If Scott had not established Richard Cumberland\\'s <i>Henry</i> (1795) in the\\r\\nfortress of the Ballantyne Novels, it would hardly be necessary to\\r\\nnotice &quot;Sir Fretful Plagiary\\'s&quot; contributions to the subject of our\\r\\nhistory. He preluded it with another, <i>Arundel</i> (1789), and followed it\\r\\nmuch later with a third, <i>John de Lancaster</i>: but there is no need to\\r\\nsay anything of these. <i>Henry</i> displays the odd hit-<i>and</i>-miss quality\\r\\nwhich seems to have attached itself to Cumberland everywhere, whether as\\r\\nnovelist, dramatist, essayist, diplomatist, poet, or anything else. It\\r\\nis, though by no means a mere &quot;plagiarism,&quot; an obvious and avowed\\r\\nimitation of Fielding, and the writer is so intent on his <i>pastiche</i>\\r\\nthat he seems quite oblivious himself, and appears to expect equal\\r\\noblivion on the part of his readers, of the fact that nearly two\\r\\ngenerations had passed. Henry is Joseph; Susan May is a much more\\r\\nelaborate and attractive Betty; the doctor\\'s wife a vulgarised and\\r\\nrepulsive Lady Booby; Ezekiel Daw, whom Scott admired, a<a name=\"Page_164\" id=\"Page_164\" /> <i>dissenting</i>\\r\\nAdams&mdash;the full force of the outrage of which variation Sir Walter\\r\\nperhaps did not feel. There are some good things in the story, but, as a\\r\\nwhole, it is chiefly valuable as an early example of that great danger\\r\\nof modern literature&mdash;the influence of the &quot;printed book&quot; itself: and in\\r\\na less degree of that forging ahead of the novel generally in public\\r\\nfavour which we are chronicling. If the kind had not been popular, and\\r\\nif Fielding had not been its great prophet, one may be pretty sure that\\r\\n<i>Henry</i> would never have existed. The causes are important: the effect\\r\\nnot quite so.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There was, however, at this time a novel-school, and not such a very\\r\\nsmall one, which had more legitimate reasons for existence, inasmuch as\\r\\nit really served as mouthpiece to the thoughts and opinions of the time,\\r\\nwhether these thoughts and opinions were good or bad. This may be called\\r\\nthe &quot;revolutionary school,&quot; and its three most distinguished scholars\\r\\nwere Bage, Holcroft, and Godwin, with Mrs. Inchbald perhaps to be added.\\r\\nThe first began considerably before the outbreak of the actual French\\r\\nRevolution and shows the influence of its causes: the others were\\r\\ndirectly influenced by itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the most remarkable of English novel-writers who are not absolute\\r\\nsuccesses, and one who, though less completely obscured by Fortune than\\r\\nsome, has never had quite his due, is Robert Bage. It was unfortunate\\r\\nfor him that he fell in with the crude generation contemporary in their\\r\\nmanhood with the French Revolution, and so manifested the crudity in\\r\\nfull. Bage, in fact, except for a certain strength of humour, is almost\\r\\nmore French than English. He has been put in the school of Richardson,\\r\\nbut it is certain that Richardson would have been shocked at the\\r\\nsupposed scholar: and it is not certain that Bage <a name=\"Page_165\" id=\"Page_165\" />would or need have\\r\\nfelt complimented by the assignment of the master. He has the special\\r\\nlaxity of the time in point of &quot;morality,&quot; or at least of decency; its\\r\\naffectations of rather childish perfectibilism and anti-theism; and the\\r\\ntendency of at least a part of it to an odd Calibanic jesting. Bage is\\r\\ngood-tempered enough as it is: but he rather suggests possible\\r\\nCarrier-and-Fouch&eacute; developments in a favourable and fostering\\r\\natmosphere. One does not quite know why Scott, who included in the\\r\\nBallantyne Novels three of Bage\\'s, <i>Mount Henneth</i> (1781), <i>Barham\\r\\nDowns</i> (1784), and <i>James Wallace</i> (1788), did not also include, if not\\r\\n<i>The Fair Syrian</i> (1787), two others, <i>Man as He is</i> (1792) and the\\r\\nstill later <i>Hermsprong</i>, or <i>Man as He is Not</i> (1796). This last has\\r\\nsometimes been regarded as Bage\\'s masterpiece: but it does not seem so\\r\\nto the present writer. It begins by the sketch of an illegitimate child,\\r\\nwritten in Bage\\'s worst vein of hard rasping irony, entirely devoid of\\r\\nthe delicate spring and &quot;give&quot; which irony requires, and which\\r\\nconstitutes the triumph even of such things as <i>A Tale of a Tub</i> and\\r\\n<i>Jonathan Wild</i>. The rather impossibly named Hermsprong himself is not\\r\\nreally so named at all, but is related (and in fact head-of-the-house)\\r\\nto the wicked or at least not good lord of the story. He is of the kind\\r\\nof Sir Charles Grandison, Rights-of-Mannified, which infests all these\\r\\nnovels and is a great bore&mdash;as, indeed, to me is the whole book. The\\r\\nearlier <i>Man as He is</i> is far better. The hero, Sir George Paradyne,\\r\\nthough of the same general class, is very much more tolerable and (being\\r\\nsometimes naughty) preferable to Grandison himself: while the heroine&mdash;a\\r\\ncertain Miss Colerain, who is a merchant\\'s daughter under a double cloud\\r\\nof her father\\'s misfortune and of calumny as regards herself&mdash;though not\\r\\nan absolute success, is worth a dozen Harriets, <a name=\"Page_166\" id=\"Page_166\" />with thirteen\\r\\nCharlottes thrown in to make &quot;25 as 24&quot; in bookseller\\'s phrase. Bage\\'s\\r\\nextravagant or perhaps only too literal manners-painting (for it was an\\r\\nodd time) appears not infrequently, as in the anecdote of a justly\\r\\nenraged, though as a matter of fact mistaken, husband, who finds a young\\r\\ngentleman sitting on his wife\\'s lap, with her arms round him, while he\\r\\nis literally and <i>en tout bien tout honneur</i> painting her face&mdash;being a\\r\\ngreat artist in that way. <i>Mount Henneth</i> is perhaps the liveliest of\\r\\nall: though its liveliness is partly achieved by less merely extravagant\\r\\nunconventionalities than this. But as a matter of fact Bage never\\r\\nentirely &quot;comes off&quot;: though there is cleverness enough in him to have\\r\\nmade a dozen popular and deservedly popular novelists at a better time\\r\\nfor the novel. For he was essentially a novelist of manners and\\r\\ncharacter at a transition time, when manners and character had come out\\r\\nof one stage and had not settled into another. Even Miss Edgeworth in\\r\\n<i>Belinda</i> shows the disadvantage of this: and she was a lady of genius,\\r\\nwhile Bage had only talent and was not quite a gentleman.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thomas Holcroft was not a gentleman at all, never pretended to the\\r\\ntitle, and would probably have been rather affronted if any one had\\r\\napplied it to him: for he was a violent Atheist and Jacobin, glorying in\\r\\nhis extraction from a shoemaker and an oysterseller, and in his\\r\\neducation as a stable boy. He was, however, a man of considerable\\r\\nintellectual power and of some literary gift, which chiefly showed\\r\\nitself in his dramas (the best known, <i>The Road to Ruin</i>), but is not\\r\\nquite absent from his novels <i>Alwyn</i> (1780), <i>Anna St. Ives</i> (1792), and\\r\\n<i>Hugh Trevor</i> (1794-1797). The series runs in curious parallel to that\\r\\nof Bage\\'s work: for <i>Alwyn</i>, the liveliest and the earliest by far of\\r\\nthe three, is little more than a study partly after<a name=\"Page_167\" id=\"Page_167\" /> Fielding, but more\\r\\nafter Smollett, with his own experiences brought in. The other two are\\r\\npurpose-novels of anarchist perfectibilism, and Holcroft enjoys the\\r\\ntraditional credit of having directly inspired Godwin. Godwin himself\\r\\nacknowledged the obligation; indeed it is well known that&mdash;in pecuniary\\r\\nmatters more particularly&mdash;Godwin had no hesitation either in incurring\\r\\nor in acknowledging obligations, always provided that he was not\\r\\nexpected to discharge them. It is possible that Holcroft\\'s rough and\\r\\nready acceptance and exaggeration of the doctrines which Rousseau had\\r\\n(as seems most probable) developed from a paradox of Diderot\\'s, gave an\\r\\nimpetus to the rather sluggish but more systematic mind of Godwin. But\\r\\nit is certain that <i>Political Justice</i>, though it is not a novel at all,\\r\\nis a much more amusing book than <i>Anna St. Ives</i>, which is one. And\\r\\nthough Holcroft (especially if the presence of this quality in his\\r\\n<i>Autobiography</i> is not wholly due to Hazlitt&mdash;there is some chance that\\r\\nit is) possessed a liveliness in narrative to which Godwin could never\\r\\nattain, there is no doubt that this enigmatical and many-sided spunger,\\r\\nphilanderer, and corruptor of youth had a much higher general\\r\\nqualification for novel-writing than any one mentioned hitherto in this\\r\\nchapter, or perhaps than any to be mentioned, except the curiously\\r\\ncontrasted pair, of Irish birth, who are to come last in it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I have sometimes thought that the greatest testimony to Godwin\\'s power\\r\\nin this respect is the idea (which even Hazlitt, though he did not share\\r\\nit, does not seem to have thought preposterous, and which seems to have\\r\\nbeen held by others who were not fools) that Godwin might be the author\\r\\nof <i>Waverley</i>. To us, looking back, the notion seems as absurd as that\\r\\nBacon could be the author of Shakespeare or Steele of the <i>Tale of a\\r\\nTub</i>: but if, instead <a name=\"Page_168\" id=\"Page_168\" />of looking back, we throw ourselves back, the\\r\\nabsurdity does not quite persist as it does in the other two instances.\\r\\nThere are some who, of course, would say, &quot;Why take this fanciful test\\r\\nof Godwin\\'s ability when you have a real one in <i>Caleb Williams</i>?&quot; The\\r\\nreasons are double: for, historically, such an estimate by\\r\\ncontemporaries is of the very first value, and to the present writer\\r\\n<i>Caleb Williams</i> (1794) has never seemed a very interesting book. It is\\r\\nimpossible to sympathise with a hero who is actuated by the very lowest\\r\\nof human motives, sheer inquisitiveness: and <i>my</i> sense of natural\\r\\njustice (which is different from Godwin\\'s) demands not that he shall\\r\\nescape, but that he shall be broken on the wheel, or burnt at a slow\\r\\nfire, or made to read <i>Political Justice</i> after the novelty of its\\r\\ncolossal want of humour has palled on him. One could sympathise with\\r\\nFalkland, but is not allowed to do so: because he is not human, except\\r\\nin his crime. But, as has been said, to those whose sporting interests\\r\\nare excited by the pleasures and hazards of the chase, these things no\\r\\ndoubt do not occur. After all <i>Caleb</i> is, in a sense, the first\\r\\n&quot;detective novel&quot;: and detective novels have always been popular, though\\r\\nthey bore some people to extinction. Far, however, be it from me to deny\\r\\nthat this popularity, especially when, as in the present case, it has\\r\\nbeen continued for four whole generations, is a real and a very\\r\\nconsiderable asset. Even if it were now to cease, it is actually funded\\r\\nand vested to Godwin\\'s credit in the <i>grand livre</i> of literary history:\\r\\nand it can never be written off. Perhaps <i>Caleb</i> is the one book of the\\r\\nlater English eighteenth century in novel for which there must always be\\r\\na public as soon as it is presented to that public. And when this is\\r\\nsaid and endorsed by those who do not personally much care for the book,\\r\\nit is at once a sufficient <a name=\"Page_169\" id=\"Page_169\" />testimony to the position of the author, and\\r\\na vindication of the not absolutely imbecile position of those who\\r\\nthought that he might have written <i>Waverley</i> and its successors. The\\r\\nway in which Godwin in his later novels came down from the mountain-tops\\r\\nof theory and paradox just as he came down from those of <i>Political\\r\\nJustice</i> itself is interesting and amusing, but not for us. As novels\\r\\nthey are certainly inferior. The best parts of <i>St. Leon</i> (1799) and\\r\\n<i>Fleetwood</i> (1805) are perhaps better than anything in <i>Caleb:\\r\\nMandeville</i> (1817) and <i>Deloraine</i> (1833) are <i>senilia</i>.<a id=\"footnotetag15\" name=\"footnotetag15\"></a><a href=\"#footnote15\"><sup>15</sup></a> The\\r\\ngraceful figure of the heroine Marguerite in <i>St. Leon</i> is said to be\\r\\nmodelled on Mary Wollstonecraft, and there are some fresh pictures of\\r\\nyouth and childhood in <i>Fleetwood</i>. But <i>St. Leon</i>, besides its\\r\\nhistorical shortcomings (which, once more, we may postpone), is full of\\r\\nfaults, from the badly managed supernatural to an only too natural\\r\\ndullness and languor of general story: nor has <i>Fleetwood</i> anything like\\r\\nthe absorbing power which <i>Caleb Williams</i> exercises, in its own way and\\r\\non its own people. Yet again we may perhaps say that the chief interest\\r\\nof Godwin, from our point of view, is his repeated and further weighted\\r\\ntestimony to the importance of the novel as an appeal to public\\r\\nattention. In this respect it was in fact displacing, not only the drama\\r\\non one side, but the sermon on the other. Not so very long before these\\r\\ntwo had almost engrossed the domain of <i>popular</i> literature, the graver\\r\\nand more precise folk habitually reading sermons as well as hearing\\r\\nthem, and the looser and lighter folk reading drama much oftener than\\r\\n(in then-existing circumstances) they had the opportunity of seeing it.\\r\\nWith the novel the &quot;address to the reader&quot; became direct and stood by\\r\\nitself. The novelist could emulate Burke with his right <a name=\"Page_170\" id=\"Page_170\" />barrel and\\r\\nLydia Languish with his left. He certainly did not always endeavour to\\r\\nprofit as well as to delight: but the double power was, from this time\\r\\nforward, shared by him with his brother in the higher and older\\r\\n<i>Dichtung</i>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Next to Godwin may be placed a lady who was much adored by that curious\\r\\nprofessor of philandering, political <i>in</i>justice, psychology, and the\\r\\nuse of the spunge, but who wisely put him off. Mrs. Inchbald\\'s\\r\\n(1753-1821) command of a certain kind of dramatic or at least theatrical\\r\\nsituation, and her propensity to Richardsonian &quot;human-heart&quot;-mongering,\\r\\nhave from time to time secured a certain number of admirers for <i>A\\r\\nSimple Story</i> (1791) and <i>Nature and Art</i> (1796). Some, availing\\r\\nthemselves of the confusion between &quot;style&quot; and &quot;handling&quot; which has\\r\\nrecently become fashionable, have even credited her with style itself.\\r\\nOf this she has nothing&mdash;unless the most conventional of\\r\\neighteenth-century phraseology, dashed with a kind of <i>marivaudage</i>\\r\\nwhich may perhaps seem original to those who do not know Marivaux\\'s\\r\\nFrench followers, shall deserve the name. She is indeed very much of an\\r\\nEnglish Madame Riccoboni. But her situations&mdash;such as the meeting in <i>A\\r\\nSimple Story</i> of a father with the daughter whom, though not exactly\\r\\ncasting her off, he has persistently refused to see, in revenge for her\\r\\nmother\\'s unfaithfulness, and the still more famous scene in <i>Nature and\\r\\nArt</i> where a judge passes the death-sentence on a woman whom he has\\r\\nbetrayed&mdash;have, as has been allowed, the dramatic or melodramatic\\r\\nquality which attracts people in &quot;decadent&quot; periods. There seems,\\r\\nindeed, to have been a certain decadent charm about Mrs. Inchbald\\r\\nherself&mdash;with her beauty, her stage skill, her strict virtue combined\\r\\nwith any amount of &quot;sensibility,&quot; her affectation of nature, and her\\r\\nbenevolence not in the <a name=\"Page_171\" id=\"Page_171\" />least sham but distinctly posing. And something\\r\\nof this rococo relish may no doubt, with a little good will and\\r\\nsympathy, be detected in her books. But of the genuine life and the\\r\\nnatural language which occasionally inspirit the much more unequal and\\r\\nmore generally commonplace work of Miss Burney, she has practically\\r\\nnothing. And she thus falls out of the main line of development, merely\\r\\nexemplifying the revolutionary and sentimental episode.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We must now, for some pages, illustrate the course of the novel by minor\\r\\nexamples: and we may begin with a brief notice of two writers, one of\\r\\nwhom might have been taken before Miss Burney and the other just after\\r\\nher chronologically: but who, in the order of thought and method, will\\r\\ncome better here. Both were natives of Scotland and both illustrate\\r\\ndifferent ways of the novel. Henry Mackenzie, an Edinburgh advocate, in\\r\\nthree books&mdash;the names of which at least are famous, while his friend\\r\\nSir Walter has preserved the books themselves in the collection so often\\r\\nmentioned&mdash;produced, in his own youth and in rapid succession, <i>The Man\\r\\nof Feeling</i> (1771), <i>The Man of the World</i> (1773), and <i>Julia de\\r\\nRoubign&eacute;</i> (1777). John Moore, a Glasgow physician, wrote, when he was\\r\\nnearly sixty, the novel of <i>Zeluco</i> (1786) and followed it up with\\r\\n<i>Edward</i> ten years afterwards and <i>Mordaunt</i> (1800). Mackenzie did good\\r\\nwork later in the periodical essay: but his fiction is chiefly the\\r\\n&quot;sensibility&quot;-novel of the French and of Sterne, reduced to the\\r\\nabsolutely absurd. From his essay-work, and from Scott\\'s and other\\r\\naccounts of him, he must have possessed humour of a kind: but the\\r\\nextremely limited character of its nature and operation may be\\r\\nexemplified by his representation of a whole press-gang as bursting into\\r\\ntears at the pathetic action and words of an old man who offers himself\\r\\nas substitute for his son.<a name=\"Page_172\" id=\"Page_172\" /> This is one of the not rare, but certainly\\r\\none of the most consummate, instances of fashion caricaturing itself in\\r\\ntotal unconsciousness. But it <i>was</i> the fashion: and Mackenzie, though\\r\\nperhaps he helped to bring it to an end, no doubt caused the shedding,\\r\\nby &quot;the fair&quot; of the time, of an ocean of tears as great as the ocean of\\r\\nport wine which was contemporaneously absorbed by &quot;the brave.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moore saw a good deal of continental society&mdash;he is indeed one of the\\r\\nfirst-hand witnesses for the events of the French Revolution&mdash;and he had\\r\\na more considerable influence on the novel than has always been allowed\\r\\nhim. <i>Zeluco</i> chiefly survives because of the exquisitely ludicrous and\\r\\nhuman trait of the English sailor who, discussing the French army,\\r\\npronounces white uniforms &quot;absurd&quot; and blue &quot;only fit for the artillery\\r\\nand the blue horse.&quot; But it is not quite certain that its villain-hero\\r\\nhad not something, and perhaps a good deal, to do with those of Mrs.\\r\\nRadcliffe who were soon to follow, and, through these, with Byron who\\r\\nwas not to be very long after. The later books are of much less\\r\\nimportance, if only because they follow the outburst of fiction which\\r\\nthe French Revolution itself ushered. But Moore, who was intimately\\r\\nconnected with Smollett, carried on the practice of making national or\\r\\nsub-national characteristics important elements of novel interest: and\\r\\nis thus noteworthy in more ways than one.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>He is a late instance&mdash;he was born in 1729 and so was only a few years\\r\\nyounger than Smollett himself&mdash;of the writers who had, for all but half\\r\\na century after Richardson\\'s appearance, accumulated patterns and\\r\\nexamples of the novel in all sorts of forms, hardly one of which lacked\\r\\nnumerous and almost innumerable imitators and followers. By these later\\r\\nyears of the century the famous &quot;Minerva Press&quot; and many others issued\\r\\ndeluges of novel-work <a name=\"Page_173\" id=\"Page_173\" />which were eagerly absorbed by readers.\\r\\n&quot;Absorbed&quot; in more senses than one: for the institution of circulating\\r\\nlibraries, while it facilitated reading, naturally tended towards the\\r\\ndestruction of the actual volumes read. Novels were rarely produced in a\\r\\nvery careful or sumptuous fashion, and good copies of those that were in\\r\\nany way popular are now rather hard to obtain: while even in the British\\r\\nMuseum it will frequently be found that only the later editions are\\r\\nrepresented. We shall finish this chapter with some instances, taken not\\r\\nquite at random, of the work of the last decades of the eighteenth and\\r\\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, winding up with more general\\r\\nnotice of two remarkable writers who represent&mdash;though at least one of\\r\\nthem lived far later&mdash;the period before Scott, and who also, as it\\r\\nhappens, represent the contrast of novel and romance in a fashion\\r\\nunusually striking. The description, as some readers will have\\r\\nanticipated, refers to Miss Edgeworth and to Maturin. But the smaller\\r\\nfry must be taken first.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is not uninteresting to compare two such books as Mrs. Bennett\\'s\\r\\n<i>Anna</i> and Mrs. Opie\\'s <i>Adeline Mowbray</i>. Published at twenty years\\'\\r\\ndistance (1785 and 1804) they show the rapid growth of the novel, even\\r\\nduring a time when nothing of the first class appeared. <i>Anna, or the\\r\\nMemoirs of a Welsh Heiress, interspersed with Anecdotes of a Nabob</i>, is\\r\\na kind of bad imitation of Miss Burney, with a catchpenny\\r\\n&quot;interspersion&quot; to suit the day. <i>Adeline Mowbray</i>, written with more\\r\\ntalent, chimes in by infusing one of the tones of <i>its</i> day&mdash;Godwinian\\r\\ntheories of life. The space between was the palmy time of that now\\r\\nalmost legendary &quot;Minerva Press&quot; which, as has been said, flooded the\\r\\never-absorbent market with stuff of which <i>The Libertine</i>, masterpiece\\r\\nof Mrs. Byrne, <i>alias</i> Charlotte Dacre,<a name=\"Page_174\" id=\"Page_174\" /> <i>alias</i> &quot;Rosa Matilda,&quot; is\\r\\nperhaps best worth singling out from its companions, <i>Hours of Solitude,\\r\\nThe Nun of St. Omers, Zofloya</i>, etc., because it specially shocked the\\r\\ncensor of the style who will be mentioned presently. It is pure (or\\r\\nnot-pure) rubbish. Angelo (the libertine) seduces the angelic Gabrielle\\r\\nde Montmorency, who follows him to Italy in male attire, saves him from\\r\\nthe wicked courtesan Oriana and her bravo Fiorenz<i>a</i> (<i>sic</i>), is married\\r\\nby him, but made miserable, and dies. He continues his misbehaviour to\\r\\ntheir children, and finally blows his brains out. &quot;Bah! it is bosh!&quot; as\\r\\nthe Master observes of something else.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It may seem iniquitous to say that some tolerably good novel-writers\\r\\nmust be more summarily treated than some bad ones here: but there is\\r\\nreason for it. Such, for instance, as Charlotte Smith and the Miss Lees\\r\\nare miles above such others as the just-mentioned polyonymous &quot;Rosa,&quot; as\\r\\nSarah Wilkinson, or as Henrietta Mosse-Rouvi&egrave;re. The first three would\\r\\nmake a very good group for a twenty-page causerie. Charlotte Smith, who\\r\\nwas tolerably expert in verse as well as prose; who anticipated, and\\r\\nperhaps taught, Scott in the double use of the name &quot;Waverley&quot;; and\\r\\nwhose <i>Old Manor House</i> (1793) is a solid but not heavy work of its\\r\\nkind&mdash;is something of a person in herself, but less of a figure in\\r\\nhistory, because she neither innovates nor does old things consummately.\\r\\nHarriet and Sophia Lee claimed innovation for the latter\\'s <i>Recess</i>\\r\\n(1783-1786), as Miss Porter did for <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i>, but the claim\\r\\ncan be even less allowed. There is nothing of real historical spirit,\\r\\nand very little goodness of any kind, in <i>The Recess. The Canterbury\\r\\nTales</i> (1797-1805) (so named merely because they are supposed to be told\\r\\nby different persons) were praised by Byron, as he praised the<a name=\"Page_175\" id=\"Page_175\" /> <i>Percy\\r\\nAnecdotes</i> and other things&mdash;either irresponsibly or impishly. They are\\r\\nnot exactly bad: but also as far as possible from consummateness.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the other hand, <i>The Convent of Grey Penitents</i>, one of the crops\\r\\nwhich rewarded Miss Wilkinson for tilling the lands of her imagination\\r\\nwith the spade of her style, <i>is</i> very nearly consummate&mdash;in badness. It\\r\\nis a fair example of the worst imitations of Mrs. Radcliffe and Mat\\r\\nLewis conjointly, though without the latter\\'s looseness. The Marquis di\\r\\nZoretti was an Italian nobleman&mdash;&quot;one of those characters in whose bosom\\r\\nresides an unquenchable thirst of avarice&quot; [&quot;<i>thirst</i> of <i>avarice</i>&quot; is\\r\\ngood!], etc. He marries, however, a lovely signora of the odd name of\\r\\nRosalthe, without a fortune, &quot;which circumstance was overlooked by his\\r\\nlordship&quot; for a very short time only. He plots to be free of her: she\\r\\ngoes to England and dies there to the genteelest of slow music. Their\\r\\nson Horatio falls in love with a certain Julietta, who is immured by\\r\\nwicked arts in the &quot;Convent of Grey Penitents,&quot; tormented by the head,\\r\\nGradisca, but rescued, and so forth. The book, if harmless, is about as\\r\\nworthless as a book can be: but it represents, very fairly, the ruck, if\\r\\nnot indeed even the main body, of the enormous horde of romances which\\r\\nissued from the press towards the end of the eighteenth century and the\\r\\nbeginning of the nineteenth, and which, in their different action on\\r\\npersons of genius, gave us <i>Zastrozzi</i> on the one side and <i>Northanger\\r\\nAbbey</i> on the other.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As for Miss Henrietta Mosse, otherwise Rouvi&egrave;re, she represents the\\r\\nother school of abortive historical novel. <i>A Peep at Our Ancestors</i>\\r\\n(1807) is fairly worthy of its ridiculous name. It is preceded by\\r\\nexpressions of thanks to the authorities of &quot;the British Museum and the\\r\\nHeralds\\'<a name=\"Page_176\" id=\"Page_176\" /> Office&quot; for the &quot;access to records&quot; vouchsafed to its author.\\r\\nAs the date of the story is 1146 (it was long before Mr. Freeman wrote)\\r\\naccess to records would certainly not have been superfluous. The actual\\r\\nresults of it are blocks of spiritless and commonplace historic\\r\\nnarrative&mdash;it is nearly all narrative, not action&mdash;diversified by\\r\\nutterances like this of Malcolm III. of Scotland, &quot;O my Edward! the deed\\r\\nwhich struck my son\\'s life has centred [<i>sic</i>] thy noble youthful bosom\\r\\nalso,&quot; or this of the heroine (such as there is), &quot;the gentle <i>elegant</i>\\r\\nAdelaise,&quot; &quot;And do I not already receive my education of thee, mamma?&quot;\\r\\nIt is really a pity that the creator of this remarkable peep-show did\\r\\nnot give references to her &quot;records,&quot; so that one might look up this\\r\\n&quot;elegant&quot; young creature of the twelfth century who talked about\\r\\n&quot;education&quot; and said &quot;mamma!&quot; But this absolute failure in\\r\\nverisimilitude is practically universal before Scott.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The works of the very beautifully named Regina Maria Roche should\\r\\nprobably be read, as they were for generations, in late childhood or\\r\\nearly youth. Even then an intelligent boy or girl would perceive some of\\r\\nthe absurdity, but might catch a charm that escapes the less receptive\\r\\noldster. They were, beyond all question, immensely popular, and\\r\\ncontinued to be so for a long time: in fact it is almost sufficient\\r\\nevidence that there is, if I mistake not, in the British Museum no\\r\\nedition earlier than the tenth of the most famous of them, <i>The Children\\r\\nof the Abbey</i> (1798). This far-renowned work opens with the exclamation\\r\\nof the heroine Amanda, &quot;Hail, sweet sojourn of my infancy!&quot; and we are\\r\\nshortly afterwards informed that in the garden &quot;the part appropriated to\\r\\nvegetables was divided from the part sacred to Flora.&quot; Otherwise, the\\r\\nsubstance of the thing is a curious sort of watered-down<a name=\"Page_177\" id=\"Page_177\" /> Richardson,\\r\\npassed through successive filtering beds of Mackenzie, and even of Mrs.\\r\\nRadcliffe. It is difficult for even the most critical taste to find much\\r\\nsavour or stimulus in the resulting liquid. But, like almost everybody\\r\\nmentioned here, Regina is a document of the demands of readers and the\\r\\nfaculty of writers: and so she &quot;standeth,&quot; if not exactly &quot;crowned,&quot; yet\\r\\nticketed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Work&mdash;somewhat later&mdash;of some interest, but not of first-class quality,\\r\\nis to be found in the <i>Discipline</i> (1811) and <i>Self-Control</i> (1814) of\\r\\nMary Brunton. A Balfour of Orkney on the father\\'s side and a Ligonier on\\r\\nthe mother\\'s, the authoress had access to the best English as well as\\r\\nScottish society, and seems to have had more than a chance of taking a\\r\\nplace in the former: but preferred to marry a minister-professor and\\r\\nsettled down to country manse life. She died in middle age and her\\r\\nhusband wrote a memoir of her. <i>Discipline</i> seems to represent a sort of\\r\\nfancy combination of the life she might have led and the life she did\\r\\nlead. Ellen Percy, the heroine, starts in the highest circles; forgets\\r\\nherself so far as to &quot;waltz<i>e</i>&quot; with a noble ne\\'er-do-weel, thereby\\r\\nearning the &quot;stern disapprobation&quot; of a respectable lover; comes down in\\r\\nthe world; has Highland experiences which, at the book\\'s early date, are\\r\\nnoteworthy; marries (like her creatress) a minister; but &quot;retains a\\r\\nlittle of her coquettish sauciness.&quot; &quot;Bless her, poor little dear!&quot; one\\r\\ncan imagine Thackeray exclaiming in his later and mellowed days. Mrs.\\r\\nBrunton\\'s letters breathe a lady-like and not unamiable propriety, and\\r\\nshe is altogether a sort of milder, though actually earlier, Miss\\r\\nFerrier.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Ireland vindicated its claim to comparative liveliness in the work of a\\r\\nbetter known contemporary and survivor. Lady Morgan\\'s (Miss Sydney\\r\\nOwenson\\'s) <i>Wild Irish Girl</i><a name=\"Page_178\" id=\"Page_178\" /> (1806) is one of the books whose titles\\r\\nhave prolonged for them a kind of shadowy existence. It is written in\\r\\nletters: and the most interesting thing about it for some readers now is\\r\\nthat the heroine supplied Thackeray with the name Glorvina, which, it\\r\\nseems, means in Irish &quot;sweet voice,&quot; if Lady Morgan is to be trusted <i>in\\r\\nrebus Celticis</i>. It is to be hoped she is: for the novel is a sort of\\r\\n<i>mac&eacute;doine</i> of Irish history, folk-lore, scenery, and what not, done up\\r\\nin a syrup of love-making <i>quant. suff.</i> Its author wrote many more\\r\\nnovels and became a butt for both good- and ill-natured satire with the\\r\\ncomic writers of the twenties, thirties, and forties. The title was\\r\\nactually borrowed by Maturin in <i>The Wild Irish</i> &quot;Boy,&quot; and it is fair\\r\\nto say that the book preceded Scott\\'s, though not Miss Edgeworth\\'s,\\r\\nexperiments in the line of the &quot;national&quot; novel. The earlier Reviewers\\r\\nwere discreditably savage on women-writers, and Lady Morgan had her\\r\\nshare of their truculence. She did not wholly deserve it: but it must be\\r\\nsaid that nothing she wrote can really be ranked as literature, save on\\r\\nthe most indiscriminate and uncritical estimate. It is, however,\\r\\ndifficult to see much harm in her.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Ida of Athens</i>, for instance, which shocked contemporaries, and which,\\r\\nby the way, has the very large first title of <i>Woman</i>, could only bring\\r\\na blush to cheeks very tickle of that sere: a yawn might come much more\\r\\neasily. The most shocking thing that the heroine, who is &quot;an attempt to\\r\\ndelineate woman in her natural state,&quot; does (and that not of malice) is\\r\\nto receive her lover in a natural bathroom. But her adventures are told\\r\\nin a style which is the oddest compound of Romantesque and Johnsonese.\\r\\n(&quot;The hour was ardent. The bath was cool. <i>He calculated upon the\\r\\nprobable necessity of its enjoyment</i>.&quot;) The spirit is the silliest and\\r\\nmost ignorant Philhellenism&mdash;all the beauty, <a name=\"Page_179\" id=\"Page_179\" />virtue, wisdom, of the\\r\\nancient Greeks being supposed to be inherited by their mongrel\\r\\nsuccessors of the early nineteenth century. An English and a Turkish\\r\\nlover dispute Ida\\'s affection or possession. There are the elaborate\\r\\npseudo-erudite notes which one has learnt to associate chiefly with\\r\\nMoore. The authoress boasts in her preface that she &quot;has already written\\r\\nalmost as many volumes as she has years,&quot; and that she has hardly ever\\r\\ncorrected her proofs. Perhaps this silliness will make some think her\\r\\nnot more an example of the savagery of contemporary criticism than a\\r\\njustification thereof.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It was in fact not only brutal man who objected to the preposterous\\r\\nexcesses of pseudo-romance: and serious or jocular parables were taken\\r\\nup against it, if not before <i>Northanger Abbey</i> was written, long before\\r\\nit was published. In 1810 a certain &quot;G.&quot; or &quot;S.G.,&quot; whose full name was\\r\\nSarah Green, wrote, besides some actual history and an attempt at the\\r\\nhistorical novel, a very curious and rather hybrid book entitled\\r\\n<i>Romance Readers and Romance Writers</i>. Its preface is an instance of\\r\\n&quot;Women, beware Women,&quot; for though it stigmatises male creatures, such as\\r\\na certain Curteis and a certain Pickersgill, it treats Lady Morgan (then\\r\\nonly Sydney Owenson) and &quot;Rosa Matilda&quot; even more roughly and asks (as\\r\\nhas been asked about a hundred years later and was asked about a hundred\\r\\nyears before), &quot;Is it not amazing that the [two] most licentious writers\\r\\nof romance are women?&quot; And it starts with a burlesque account of a\\r\\ncertain Margaret Marsham who exclaims, &quot;What then? to add to my earthly\\r\\nmiseries am I to be called Peggy? My name is Margari<i>tt</i>a!&quot; &quot;I am sure\\r\\nthat if I am called Peggy again I shall go into a fit.&quot; But this promise\\r\\nof something to complete the trio with <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>The\\r\\nHeroine</i> (to be presently mentioned)<a name=\"Page_180\" id=\"Page_180\" /> is not maintained. Not only does\\r\\nthe writer force the note of parody too much by making &quot;Margaritta&quot; say\\r\\nto herself, &quot;Poor persecuted <i>dove</i> that I am,&quot; and adore a labourer\\'s\\r\\nshirt on a hedge, but she commits the far more fatal fault of exchanging\\r\\nher jest for earnest. Margaritta&mdash;following her romance-models&mdash;falls a\\r\\nvictim to an unprincipled great lady and the usual wicked baronet&mdash;at\\r\\nwhose head, one is bound to say, she flings herself with such violence\\r\\nas no baronet could possibly resist. Her sister Mary, innocent of\\r\\nromance-reading and all other faults, is, though not as guilty, as\\r\\nunlucky almost as Margaret: and by far the greater part of the book is\\r\\nan unreal presentment, in nearly the worst manner of the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury itself, of virtuous curates, <i>un</i>virtuous &quot;tonish&quot; rectors, who\\r\\ncalmly propose to seduce their curates\\' daughters (an offence which, for\\r\\nobvious reasons, must, in the worst times, have been unusual), libertine\\r\\nladies, and reckless &quot;fashionables&quot; of all kinds. The preface and the\\r\\nopening create expectations, not merely of amusement but of power, which\\r\\nare by no means fulfilled. It is &quot;S.G.&quot; who asserts that <i>Ida of Athens</i>\\r\\n&quot;has brought a blush to the cheek of many,&quot; and one can only repeat the\\r\\nsuggested substitution.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The only faults that can be found with <i>The Heroine</i> or <i>The Adventures\\r\\nof Cherubina</i>, by Eaton Stannard Barrett, which appeared in the same\\r\\nyear, with no very different object and subject, though written in\\r\\nlighter vein, are one that it could not help and another that it could.\\r\\nUnjustly, but unavoidably, the first is the worst. That it is a\\r\\nburlesque rather overdone&mdash;a burlesque <i>burlesqu&eacute;</i>&mdash;not in the manner of\\r\\nThackeray, but in that of some older and some more recent writers&mdash;is\\r\\nunfortunate, but not fatal. One can forgive&mdash;one can even enjoy&mdash;the\\r\\nghost who not <a name=\"Page_181\" id=\"Page_181\" />only sneezes but says, &quot;D&mdash;n, all is blown!&quot; When the\\r\\nheroine is actually locked up with a man in a chest one is more\\r\\ndoubtful: recovering when the Marquis de Furioso, &quot;bowing gracefully to\\r\\nthe bride,&quot; stabs himself to the heart, which is almost &quot;the real\\r\\nMackay&quot; as they say in the North. The slight awkwardness of snow falling\\r\\nthe day after the characters have been eating strawberries does not\\r\\namuse <i>us</i> much, because this is a comparatively ordinary event of the\\r\\nearly twentieth century, whatever it might be of the early nineteenth.\\r\\nBut what is fatal, though the author could not help it, is that the\\r\\ninfinitely lighter, more artistic, and more lethal dart of <i>Northanger\\r\\nAbbey</i> had been launched by the pen, if not the press, more than a dozen\\r\\nyears before.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are few more curious and interesting personages in the history of\\r\\nthe English Novel than Maria Edgeworth. The variety of her\\r\\naccomplishment in the kind was extraordinary: and in more than one of\\r\\nits species she went very near perfection. One is never quite certain\\r\\nwhether the perpetual meddling of her rather celebrated father\\r\\nRichard&mdash;one of the capital examples of the unpractical pragmatists and\\r\\nclever-silly crotcheteers who produced and were produced by the\\r\\nRevolutionary period&mdash;did her more harm than good. It certainly loaded\\r\\nher work with superfluous and (to us) disgusting didacticism: but it\\r\\nmight be contended that, without its stimulus, she would have done much\\r\\nless, perhaps nothing. As it was, she lived for more than eighty years\\r\\n(till all but the middle of the nineteenth century) and wrote for more\\r\\nthan sixty. Her work is thus very bulky: but it may be considered, for\\r\\nour present purpose, in three groups&mdash;her short stories written mainly\\r\\nbut not wholly for children; her regular novels; and her Irish studies.\\r\\nOf these the middle division <a name=\"Page_182\" id=\"Page_182\" />has been, and no doubt has deserved to be,\\r\\nthe least popular: but its principal example, <i>Belinda</i> (1801)\\r\\n(<i>Patronage</i>, a longer and later book, and others are inferior), is\\r\\nconsiderably better than is usually admitted and, by its early date,\\r\\ndeserves special notice here. It preceded Miss Austen\\'s work in\\r\\npublication, and is specially cited by her as a capital example of novel\\r\\nin connection with the work of Miss Burney: and it is evidently founded\\r\\non study of the latter, of which, indeed, it is the first really worthy\\r\\ncontinuation. Maria has nothing so good as Fanny\\'s Smiths and\\r\\nBranghtons: but the whole book is far superior to <i>Evelina</i>. The\\r\\nextravagance of the <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> society which it represents has\\r\\nprobably disguised from not a few readers who do not know the facts, the\\r\\nother fact that it is a real attempt at realist observation of manners:\\r\\nand it has the narrative merit which was Miss Edgeworth\\'s gift of\\r\\nnature. But the hero is patchy and improbable: the heroine, a good and\\r\\nquite possible girl, is not sufficiently &quot;reliefed out&quot;; and the most\\r\\nimportant figures of the book, Lord and Lady Delacour, almost great\\r\\nsuccesses, are not helped by the peculiar academic-didactic moralising\\r\\nwhich she had caught from Marmontel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The following of that ingenious and now too much under-valued writer\\r\\nstood her in better stead in the <i>Moral Tales</i> (1801) (which she\\r\\ndeliberately called after his<a id=\"footnotetag16\" name=\"footnotetag16\"></a><a href=\"#footnote16\"><sup>16</sup></a>), the<a name=\"Page_183\" id=\"Page_183\" /> <i>Popular Tales</i> of the same\\r\\nkind, and (though Marmontel did not intentionally write for children)\\r\\nthe delightful <i>Parent\\'s Assistant</i> (1801) and <i>Frank</i>. In the two\\r\\nfirst-named divisions, the narrative faculty just mentioned appears\\r\\nadmirably, together with another and still greater gift, that of\\r\\ncharacter-painting, and even a grasp of literary and social satire,\\r\\nwhich might not be anticipated from some of her other books. The French\\r\\ngoverness (<i>Mlle. Panache</i>) and the satire on romantic young-ladyism\\r\\n(<i>Angelina</i>) are excellent examples of this. As for the pure child\\'s\\r\\nstories, generation after generation of competent criticism, childish\\r\\nand adult, has voted them by acclamation into almost the highest place\\r\\npossible: and the gain-sayers have for the most part been idle\\r\\nparadoxers, ill-conditioned snarlers at things clean and sweet, or fools\\r\\npure and simple.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The &quot;Irish brigade&quot; of the work&mdash;<i>Castle Rackrent</i> (1800), <i>Ormond</i>, and\\r\\n<i>The Absentee</i>, with the non-narrative but closely-connected <i>Essay on\\r\\nIrish Bulls</i>&mdash;have perhaps commanded the most unchequered applause. They\\r\\nare not quite free from the sentimentality and the didacticism which\\r\\nwere both rampant in the novel of Miss Edgeworth\\'s earlier time: but\\r\\nthese are atoned for by a quite new use of the &quot;national&quot; element. Even\\r\\nSmollett and, following Smollett, Moore had chiefly availed themselves\\r\\nof this for its farcical or semi-farcical opportunities. Miss Edgeworth\\r\\ndid not neglect these, but she did not confine herself to them: and such\\r\\ncharacters as Corny the &quot;King of the Black Isles&quot; in <i>Ormond</i> actually\\r\\nadd a new province and a new pleasure to fiction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Her importance is thus very great: and it only wanted the proverbial or\\r\\nanecdotic &quot;That!&quot; to make it much greater. &quot;That!&quot; as it generally is,\\r\\nwas in her case the <a name=\"Page_184\" id=\"Page_184\" />last fusing touch of genius to accomplish the\\r\\n<i>grand oeuvre</i>&mdash;the perfect projection. She had humour, pathos,\\r\\nknowledge of the world, power of drawing it, acquaintance with\\r\\nliterature, shrewd common sense, an excellent style when she was allowed\\r\\nto write in her own way, the feelings of a lady who was also a good\\r\\nwoman. King Charles is made to say in <i>Woodstock</i> that &quot;half the things\\r\\nin the world remind him of the Tales of Mother Goose.&quot; It is\\r\\nastonishing, in the real complimentary sense, how many things remind one\\r\\nof situations, passages, phrases, in Miss Edgeworth\\'s works of all the\\r\\nkinds from <i>Castle Rackrent</i> to <i>Frank</i>. She also had a great and an\\r\\nacknowledged influence on Scott, a considerable and a certainly not\\r\\ndisavowed influence on Miss Austen. She is good reading always, however\\r\\nmuch we may sometimes pish and pshaw at the untimely poppings-in of the\\r\\nplatitudes and crotchets (for he was that most abominable of things, a\\r\\nplatitudinous crotcheteer) of Richard her father. She was a girl of\\r\\nfourteen when the beginnings of the domestic novel were laid in\\r\\n<i>Evelina</i>, and she lived to see it triumph in <i>Vanity Fair</i>. But her own\\r\\nwork, save in some of her short stories, which are pretty perfect,\\r\\nrepresents the imperfect stage of the development&mdash;the stage when the\\r\\nnovel is trying for the right methods and struggling to get into the\\r\\nright ways, but has not wholly mastered the one or reached the others.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are those who would assign what they might call &quot;higher genius,&quot;\\r\\nor &quot;rarer gift,&quot; or something similar, to her countryman Charles Robert\\r\\nMaturin. The present writer is not very fond of these measurings\\r\\ntogether of things incommensurable&mdash;these attempts to rank the &quot;light\\r\\nwhite sea-mew&quot; as superior or inferior to the &quot;sleek black pantheress.&quot;\\r\\nIt is enough to say that while<a name=\"Page_185\" id=\"Page_185\" /> Miss Edgeworth very deliberately adopted\\r\\nthe novel, and even, as we have seen, slightly satirised at least\\r\\npseudo-romance, Maturin was romantic or nothing. His life was hardly\\r\\nhalf hers in length, and his temperament appears to have been as\\r\\ndiscontented as hers was sunny: but he had his successes in drama as\\r\\nwell as in novel, and one of his attempts in the latter kind had a\\r\\nwide-ranging influence abroad as well as at home, has been recently\\r\\nprinted both in whole and in part, and undoubtedly ranks among the\\r\\nnovels which any tolerably well instructed person would enumerate if he\\r\\nwere asked to give a pretty full list of celebrated (and deservedly\\r\\ncelebrated) books of the kind in English. The others fall quite out of\\r\\ncomparison. <i>The Fatal Revenge</i> or the <i>Family of Montorio</i> (1807) is a\\r\\ntry for the &quot;furthest&quot; in the Radcliffe-Lewis direction, discarding\\r\\nindeed the crudity of <i>The Monk</i>, but altogether neglecting the\\r\\nrestraint of <i>Udolpho</i> and its companions in the use of the\\r\\nsupernatural. <i>The Wild Irish Boy</i> (1808), <i>The Milesian Chief</i> (1812),\\r\\n<i>Women</i> (1818), and <i>The Albigenses</i> (1824) are negligible, the last,\\r\\nperhaps, rather less so than the others. But <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i>\\r\\n(1820) is in quite a different case. It has faults in plenty&mdash;especially\\r\\na narrative method of such involution that, as it has been said, &quot;a\\r\\nconsiderable part of the book consists of a story told to a certain\\r\\nperson, who is a character in a longer story, found in a manuscript\\r\\nwhich is delivered to a third person, who narrates the greater part of\\r\\nthe novel to a fourth person, who is the namesake and descendant of the\\r\\ntitle-hero.&quot; Stripped of these tiresome lendings (which, as has been\\r\\nfrequently pointed out, were a mania with the eighteenth century and\\r\\nnaturally grew to such intricacy as this), the central story, though not\\r\\nexactly new, is impressive: and it is told and worked out in manner more\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_186\" id=\"Page_186\" />impressive, because practically novel, save for, perhaps, a little\\r\\nsuggestion from <i>Vathek</i>. Melmoth has bartered his soul with the devil\\r\\nfor something like immortality and other privileges, including the\\r\\nunusual one of escaping doom if he can get some one to take the bargain\\r\\noff his hands. This leads up to numerous episodes or chapters in which\\r\\nMelmoth endeavours to obtain substitutes: and in one of these the love\\r\\ninterest of the book&mdash;the, of course, fatal love of Melmoth himself for\\r\\na Spanish-Indian girl Immalee or Isidora&mdash;is related with some real\\r\\npathos and passion, though with a good deal of mere sentiment and\\r\\ntwaddle. Maturin is stronger in his terror-scenes, and affected his own\\r\\ngeneration very powerfully: his influence being so great in France that\\r\\nBalzac attempted a variation and continuation, and that there are\\r\\nconstant references to the book in the early French Romantics. In fact\\r\\nfor this kind of &quot;sensation&quot; Maturin is, putting <i>Vathek</i> aside, quite\\r\\nthe chief of the whole school. But it is doubtful whether he had many\\r\\nother gifts as a novelist, and this particular one is one that cannot be\\r\\nexercised very frequently, and is very difficult to exercise at all\\r\\nwithout errors and extravagances.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The child-literature of this school and period was very large, and, had\\r\\nwe space, would be worth dealing with at length&mdash;as in the instances of\\r\\nthe famous <i>Sandford and Merton</i> (1783-1789) by Thomas Day, Richard\\r\\nEdgeworth\\'s friend, of Mrs. Trimmer\\'s <i>Story of the Robins</i>, and others.\\r\\nIt led up to the definitely religious school of children\\'s books, first\\r\\nevangelical, then tractarian, with which we shall deal later: but was\\r\\nitself as a rule utilitarian&mdash;or sentimental&mdash;moral rather than directly\\r\\nreligious. It is, however, like other things&mdash;indeed almost all\\r\\nthings&mdash;in this chapter&mdash;a document of the fashion in which the novel\\r\\nwas &quot;filling <a name=\"Page_187\" id=\"Page_187\" />all numbers&quot; and being used for all purposes. It was, of\\r\\ncourse, in this case, nearest to the world-old &quot;fable&quot;&mdash;especially to\\r\\nthe moral apologues of which the medi&aelig;val sermon-writers and others had\\r\\nbeen so fond. But its popularity, especially when taken in connection\\r\\nwith the still surviving distrust of fiction, is valuable. It involves\\r\\nnot merely the principle that &quot;the devil shall not have all the best\\r\\ntunes,&quot; but the admission that this tune is good.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This point, and that other also frequently mentioned and closely\\r\\nconnected with it, that the novel at this time overflows into almost\\r\\nevery conceivable department of subject and object, are the main facts\\r\\nof a general historical kind, which should be in the reader\\'s mind as\\r\\nthe upshot of this chapter. But there is a third, almost as important as\\r\\neither, and that is the almost universal coming short of complete\\r\\nsuccess&mdash;the lack of consummateness, the sense that if the Novel Israel\\r\\nis not exactly still in the wilderness, it has not yet crossed the\\r\\nJordan. Even if we take in the last chapter, and its comparative giants,\\r\\nwith the present and its heroes, ordinary folk, and pygmies, we shall\\r\\nscarcely find more than one great master, Fielding, and one little\\r\\nmasterpiece, <i>Vathek</i>, deserving the adjective &quot;consummate.&quot; No doubt\\r\\nthe obvious explanation&mdash;that the hour was not because the man had not\\r\\ncome except in this single case&mdash;is a good one: but it need not be left\\r\\nin the bare isolation of its fatalism. There are at least several\\r\\nsubsidiary considerations which it is well to advance. The transition\\r\\nstate of manners and language cannot be too often insisted upon: for\\r\\nthis affected the process at both ends, giving the artist in fictitious\\r\\nlife an uncertain model to copy and unstable materials to work in. The\\r\\ndeficiency of classical patterns&mdash;at a time which still firmly believed,\\r\\nfor the most part, that all good work in literature had been <a name=\"Page_188\" id=\"Page_188\" />so done by\\r\\nthe ancients that it could at best be emulated&mdash;should count for\\r\\nsomething: the scanty respect in which the kind was held for something\\r\\nmore. As to one of the most important species, frequent allusions have\\r\\nbeen made, and in the next chapter full treatment will be given, to the\\r\\ncauses which made the <i>historical</i> novel impossible until very late in\\r\\nthe century, and decidedly unlikely to be good even then. Perhaps,\\r\\nwithout attempting further detail, we may conclude by saying that the\\r\\nproductions of this time present, and present inevitably, the nonage and\\r\\nnovitiate of a branch of art which hardly possessed any genuine\\r\\nrepresentatives when the century was born and which numbered them, bad\\r\\nand good, by thousands and almost tens of thousands at its death. In the\\r\\ninterval there had been continuous and progressive exercise; there had\\r\\nbeen some great triumphs; there had been not a little good and pleasant\\r\\nwork; and of even the work that was less good and less pleasant one may\\r\\nsay that it at least represented experiment, and might save others from\\r\\nfailure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_V\" id=\"CHAPTER_V\" /><a name=\"Page_189\" id=\"Page_189\" />CHAPTER V</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>SCOTT AND MISS AUSTEN</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In 1816 Sir Thomas Bernard, baronet, barrister, and philanthropist,\\r\\npublished, having it is said written it three years previously, an\\r\\nagreeable dialogue on <i>Old Age</i>, which was very popular, and reached its\\r\\nfifth edition in 1820. The interlocutors are Bishops Hough and Gibson\\r\\nand Mr. Lyttleton, the supposed time 1740&mdash;the year, by accident or\\r\\ndesign, of <i>Pamela</i>. In this the aged and revered &quot;martyr of Magdalen&quot;\\r\\nis mildly reproached by his brother prelate for liking novels. Hough\\r\\nputs off the reproach as mildly, and in a most academic manner, by\\r\\nsaying that he only admits them <i>speciali grati&acirc;</i>. This was in fact the\\r\\ngeneral attitude to the whole kind, not merely in 1740, but after all\\r\\nthe work of nearly another life-time as long as Hough\\'s&mdash;almost in 1816\\r\\nitself. Yet when Sir Thomas published his little book, notice to quit,\\r\\nof a double kind, had been served on this fallacy. Miss Austen\\'s life\\r\\nwas nearly done, and some of her best work had not been published: but\\r\\nthe greater part had. Scott was in his actual hey-day. Between them,\\r\\nthey had dealt and were dealing&mdash;from curiously different sides and in\\r\\nas curiously different manners&mdash;the death-blow to the notion that the\\r\\nnovel was an inferior if not actually discreditable kind, suitable for\\r\\nweak intellects only, and likely to weaken strong ones, frivolous when\\r\\nnot positively immoral, giving a distaste for serious reading, implying\\r\\nin the writer an <a name=\"Page_190\" id=\"Page_190\" />inability to do anything more serious, and generally\\r\\npresenting a glaring contrast to real &quot;literature.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Interesting as each of these two great novelists is individually, the\\r\\ninterest of the pair, from our present historical point of view, is\\r\\nalmost greater; and the way in which they complete each other is hardly\\r\\nshort of uncanny. Before their time, despite the great examples of prose\\r\\nfiction produced by Bunyan, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and\\r\\nSterne, and the remarkable determination towards the life of ordinary\\r\\nsociety given, or instanced, by Miss Burney; despite the immense\\r\\nnovel-production of the last half of the eighteenth century and the\\r\\nfirst decade of the nineteenth&mdash;it is hardly too much to say that &quot;the\\r\\nnovel,&quot; as such, had not found its proper way or ways at all. Bunyan\\'s\\r\\nwas an example of genius in a peculiar kind of the novel: as, in a very\\r\\ndifferent one, was Sterne\\'s. Defoe, possessing some of the rarest gifts\\r\\nof the novelist, was quite lacking in others. Richardson was not only\\r\\n<i>exemplar vitiis imitabile</i> and <i>imitatum</i>, but it might be doubted\\r\\nwhether, even when not faulty, he was not more admirable than\\r\\ndelightful. Smollett, like Defoe, was not much more than part of a\\r\\nnovelist: and Miss Burney lacked strength, equality, and range. There\\r\\nremained Fielding: and it certainly is not here that any restrictions or\\r\\nallowances will be insinuated as to Fielding\\'s praise. But Fielding\\'s\\r\\nnovels are a circle in which no one else save Thackeray has ever been\\r\\nable to walk. And what we are looking for now is something rather\\r\\ndifferent from this&mdash;a masterpiece, or masterpieces, which may not only\\r\\nyield delight and excite admiration in itself or themselves, but may\\r\\nbring forth fruit in others&mdash;fruit less masterly perhaps, but of the\\r\\nsame or a similar kind. In other words, nobody\\'s work yet&mdash;save in the\\r\\nspecial kinds&mdash;had <a name=\"Page_191\" id=\"Page_191\" />been capable of yielding a novel-<i>formula</i>: nobody\\r\\nhad hit upon the most capital and fruitful novel-ideas. And nearly\\r\\neverybody had, in the kind, done work curiously and almost\\r\\nincomprehensibly faulty. Of these faults, the worst, perhaps, were\\r\\nclassable under the general head of inverisimilitude. Want of truth to\\r\\nnature in character and dialogue, extravagant and clumsy plotting,\\r\\nneglect of (indeed entire blindness to) historic colour, unreal and\\r\\nunobserved description&mdash;all these things might be raised to a height or\\r\\nsunk to a bathos in the work of the Minerva Press&mdash;but there was far too\\r\\nmuch of them in <i>all</i> the novel work of these sixty or seventy years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Although the facts and dates are well enough known, it is perhaps not\\r\\nalways remembered that Miss Austen, while representing what may, using a\\r\\nrather objectionable and ambiguous word, be called a more &quot;modern&quot; style\\r\\nof novel than Scott\\'s, began long before him and had almost finished her\\r\\nwork before his really began. If that wonderful Bath bookseller had not\\r\\nkept <i>Northanger Abbey</i> in a drawer, instead of publishing it, it would\\r\\nhave had nearly twenty years start of <i>Waverley</i>. And it must be\\r\\nremembered that <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, though it is, perhaps, chiefly\\r\\nthought of as a parody-satire on the school of Mrs. Radcliffe, is, as\\r\\nthese parody-satires have a habit of being, a great deal more. If\\r\\nCatherine had not made a fool of herself about the <i>Orphan of the Black\\r\\nForest</i> and <i>Horrid Mysteries</i> (or rather if everything relating to this\\r\\nwere &quot;blacked out&quot; as by a Russian censor) there would still remain the\\r\\nadmirable framework of her presentation at Bath and her intercourse with\\r\\nthe Tilneys; the more admirable character-sketches of herself&mdash;the\\r\\ntriumph of the ordinary made not ordinary&mdash;and the Thorpes; the most\\r\\nadmirable flashes of satire and knowledge of human <a name=\"Page_192\" id=\"Page_192\" />nature, not\\r\\n&quot;promiscuous&quot; or thrown out <i>apropos</i> of things in general, but acting\\r\\nas assistants and invigorators to the story.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the few words just used lies, as far as it can be comprehended in any\\r\\nfew words, the secret both of Miss Austen and of Scott. It has been\\r\\nsaid&mdash;more than once or twice, I fear&mdash;that hardly until Bunyan and\\r\\nDefoe do we get an interesting story&mdash;something that grasps us and\\r\\ncarries us away with it&mdash;at all. Except in the great eighteenth-century\\r\\nFour the experience is not repeated, save in parts of Miss Burney and\\r\\nMiss Edgeworth later&mdash;it is simulated rather than actually brought about\\r\\nby the Terror-novel&mdash;except in the eternal exception of <i>Vathek</i>&mdash;for\\r\\nMaturin did not do his best work till much later. The absence of it is\\r\\nmainly due to a concatenation of inabilities on the part of the writers.\\r\\nThey don\\'t know what they ought to do: and in a certain sense it may\\r\\neven be said that they don\\'t know what they are doing. In the worst\\r\\nexamples surveyed in the last chapter, such as <i>A Peep at Our\\r\\nAncestors</i>, this ignorance plumbs the abyss&mdash;blocks of dull serious\\r\\nnarrative, almost or quite without action, and occasional insertions of\\r\\nflat, insipid, and (to any one with a little knowledge) impossible\\r\\nconversation, forming their staple. Of the better class of books, from\\r\\nthe <i>Female Quixote</i> to <i>Discipline</i>, this cannot fairly be said: but\\r\\nthere is always something wanting. Frequently, as in both the books just\\r\\nmentioned, the writer is too serious and too desirous to instruct.\\r\\nHardly ever is there a real <i>projection</i> of character, in the round and\\r\\nliving&mdash;only pale, sketchy &quot;academies&quot; that neither live, nor move, nor\\r\\nhave any but a fitful and partial being. The conversation is, perhaps,\\r\\nthe worst feature of all&mdash;for it follows the contemporary stage in\\r\\nadopting a conventional lingo which, as we know <a name=\"Page_193\" id=\"Page_193\" />from private letters as\\r\\nearly as Gray\\'s and Walpole\\'s, if not even as Chesterfield\\'s and those\\r\\nof men and women older still, was <i>not</i> the language of well-bred,\\r\\nwell-educated, and intelligent persons at any time during the century.\\r\\nAs for the Fourth Estate of the novel&mdash;description&mdash;it had rarely been\\r\\nattempted even by the great masters. In fact it has been pointed out as\\r\\nperhaps the one unquestionable merit of Mrs. Radcliffe that&mdash;following\\r\\nthe taste for the picturesque which, starting from Gray and popularised\\r\\nby Gilpin, was spreading over the country&mdash;she did attempt to introduce\\r\\nthis important feature, and did partly, in a rococo way, succeed in\\r\\nintroducing it. As for plot, that has never been our strong point&mdash;we\\r\\nseem to have been contented with <i>Tom Jones</i> as payment in full of that\\r\\ndemand.<a id=\"footnotetag17\" name=\"footnotetag17\"></a><a href=\"#footnote17\"><sup>17</sup></a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now, this was all changed. It is doubtful whether if <i>Northanger Abbey</i>\\r\\nhad actually appeared in 1796 it would have been appreciated&mdash;Miss\\r\\nAusten, like other writers of genius, had, not exactly as the common but\\r\\nincorrect phrase goes, to create the taste for her own work, but to\\r\\narouse the long dormant appetite which she was born to satisfy. Yet,\\r\\nlooking back a hundred years, it seems impossible that anybody of wits\\r\\nshould have failed at once to discover the range, the perfection, and\\r\\nthe variety of the new gift, or set of gifts. Here all the elements come\\r\\nin: and something with them that enlivens and intensifies them all. The\\r\\nplot is not intricate, but there is a plot&mdash;good deal more, perhaps,\\r\\nthan is generally noticed, and more than Miss Austen herself sometimes\\r\\ngave, as, for instance, in <i>Mansfield Park</i>. It is even rather artfully\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_194\" id=\"Page_194\" />worked out&mdash;the selfish gabble of John Thorpe, who may look to\\r\\nsuperficial observers like a mere outsider, playing an important part\\r\\n<i>twice</i> in the evolution. There is not lavish but amply sufficient\\r\\ndescription and scenery&mdash;the Bath vignettes, especially the Beechencliff\\r\\nprospect; the sketch of the Abbey itself and of Henry\\'s parsonage, etc.\\r\\nBut it is in the other two constituents that the blowing of the new wind\\r\\nof the spirit is most perceptible. The character-drawing is simply\\r\\nwonderful, especially in the women&mdash;though the men lack nothing. John\\r\\nThorpe has been glanced at&mdash;there had been nothing like him before, save\\r\\nin Fielding and in the very best of the essayists and dramatists.\\r\\nGeneral Tilney has been found fault with as unnatural and excessive: but\\r\\nonly by people who do not know what &quot;harbitrary gents&quot; fathers of\\r\\nfamilies, who were not only squires and members of parliament, but\\r\\nmilitary men, could be in the eighteenth century&mdash;and perhaps a little\\r\\nlater. His son Henry, in common with most of his author\\'s <i>jeunes\\r\\npremiers</i>, has been similarly objected to as colourless. He really has a\\r\\ngreat deal of subdued individuality, and it <i>had</i> to be subdued, because\\r\\nit would not have done to let him be too superior to Catherine. James\\r\\nMorland and Frederick Tilney are not to be counted as more than &quot;walking\\r\\ngentlemen,&quot; Mr. Allen only as a little more: and they fulfil their law.\\r\\nBut Isabella Thorpe is almost better than her brother, as being nearer\\r\\nto pure comedy and further from farce; Eleanor Tilney is adequate; and\\r\\nMrs. Allen is sublime on her scale. A novelist who, at the end of the\\r\\neighteenth century, could do Mrs. Allen, could do anything that she\\r\\nchose to do; and might be trusted never to attempt anything that she\\r\\ncould not achieve. And yet the heroine is perhaps&mdash;as she ought to\\r\\nbe&mdash;the greatest triumph of the whole, and the most indicative of <a name=\"Page_195\" id=\"Page_195\" />the\\r\\nnew method. The older heroines had generally tried to be extraordinary:\\r\\nand had failed. Catherine tries to be ordinary: and is an extraordinary\\r\\nsuccess. She is pretty, but not beautiful: sensible and well-natured,\\r\\nbut capable, like most of us, of making a complete fool of herself and\\r\\nof doing complete injustice to other people; fairly well educated, but\\r\\nnot in the least learned or accomplished. In real life she would be\\r\\nsimply a unit in the thousands of quite nice but ordinary girls whom\\r\\nProvidence providentially provides in order that mankind shall not be\\r\\nalone. In literature she is more precious than rubies&mdash;exactly because\\r\\nart has so masterfully followed and duplicated nature.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Precisely to what extent the attractive quality of this art is enhanced\\r\\nby the pervading irony of the treatment would be a very difficult\\r\\nproblem to work out. It is scarcely hazardous to say that irony is the\\r\\nvery salt of the novel: and that just as you put salt even in a cake, so\\r\\nit is not wise to neglect it wholly even in a romance. Life itself, as\\r\\nsoon as it gets beyond mere vegetation, is notoriously full of irony:\\r\\nand no imitation of it which dispenses with the seasoning can be worth\\r\\nmuch. That Miss Austen\\'s irony is consummate can hardly be said to be\\r\\nmatter of serious contest.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It has sometimes been thought&mdash;perhaps mistakenly&mdash;that the exhibition\\r\\nof it in <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is, though a very creditable essay, <i>not</i>\\r\\nconsummate. But <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is known to be, in part, little if\\r\\nat all later than <i>Northanger Abbey</i>: and there can again be very little\\r\\ndispute among judges in any way competent as to the quality of the irony\\r\\nthere. Nor does it much matter what part of this wonderful book was\\r\\nwritten later and what earlier: for its ironical character is\\r\\nall-pervading, <a name=\"Page_196\" id=\"Page_196\" />in almost every character, except Jane and her lover who\\r\\nare mere foils to Elizabeth and Darcy, and even in these to some extent;\\r\\nand in the whole story, even in the at least permitted suggestion that\\r\\nthe sight of Pemberley, and Darcy\\'s altered demeanour, had something to\\r\\ndo with Elizabeth\\'s resignation of the old romantic part of <i>Belle dame\\r\\nsans merci</i>. It may further be admitted, even by those who protest\\r\\nagainst the undervaluation of <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, that <i>Pride and\\r\\nPrejudice</i> flies higher, and maintains its flight triumphantly. It is\\r\\nnot only longer; it is not only quite independent of parody or contrast\\r\\nwith something previous; but it is far more intricate and elaborate as\\r\\nwell as more original. Elizabeth herself is not merely an ordinary girl:\\r\\nand the putting forward of her, as an extraordinary yet in no single\\r\\npoint unnatural one, is victoriously carried out. Her father, in spite\\r\\nof (nay, perhaps, including) his comparative collapse when he is called\\r\\nupon, not as before to talk but to act, in the business of Lydia\\'s\\r\\nflight, is a masterpiece. Mr. Collins is, once more by common consent of\\r\\nthe competent, unsurpassed, if not peerless: those who think him\\r\\nunnatural simply do not know nature. Shakespeare and Fielding were the\\r\\nonly predecessors who could properly serve as sponsors to &quot;this young\\r\\nlady&quot; (as Scott delightfully calls her) on her introduction among the\\r\\nimmortals on the strength of this character alone. Lady Catherine is not\\r\\nmuch the inferior (it would have been pleasing to tell her so) of her\\r\\n<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> and chaplain. Of almost all the characters, and of quite the\\r\\nwhole book, it is scarcely extravagant to say that it could not have\\r\\nbeen better on its own scale and scheme&mdash;that it is difficult to\\r\\nconceive any scheme and scale on which it could have been better. And,\\r\\nyet once more, there is nothing out of the way in it&mdash;the only thing not\\r\\nof <a name=\"Page_197\" id=\"Page_197\" />absolutely everyday occurrence, the elopement of Lydia, happens on\\r\\nso many days still, with slight variations, that it can hardly be called\\r\\na licence.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The same qualities appear throughout the other books, whether in more or\\r\\nless quintessence and with less or more alloy is a question rather of\\r\\nindividual taste than for general or final critical decision. <i>Sense and\\r\\nSensibility</i>, the first actually to appear (1811), is believed to have\\r\\nbeen written about the same time as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, which\\r\\nappeared two years later, and <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, which did not see the\\r\\nlight till its author was dead. It is the weakest of the three&mdash;perhaps\\r\\nit is the weakest of all: but the weakness is due rather to an error of\\r\\njudgment than to a lack of power. Like <i>Northanger Abbey</i> it has a\\r\\ncertain dependence on something else: the extravagances of Marianne\\r\\nsatirise the Sensibility-novel just as those of Catherine do the\\r\\nTerror-story of the immediate past. But it is on a much larger scale:\\r\\nand things of the kind are better in miniature. Moreover, the author\\'s\\r\\nsense of creative faculty made her try to throw up and contrast her\\r\\nheroine with other characters, in a way which she had not attempted in\\r\\n<i>Northanger Abbey</i>: and good as these are in themselves, they make a\\r\\nless perfect whole. Indeed, in the order of thought, <i>Sense and\\r\\nSensibility</i> is the &quot;youngest&quot; of the novels&mdash;the least self-criticised.\\r\\nNothing in it shows lack of power (John Dashwood and his wife are of the\\r\\nfirst order); a good deal in it shows lack of knowledge exactly how to\\r\\ndirect that power.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Mansfield Park</i> (1814), though hardly as brilliant as <i>Pride and\\r\\nPrejudice</i>, shows much more maturity than <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Much\\r\\nof it is quite consummate, the character of Mrs. Norris especially: and\\r\\nfor subtly <a name=\"Page_198\" id=\"Page_198\" />interwoven phrase without emphasis, conveying knowledge and\\r\\ncriticism of life, it has few equals. But it has an elopement. <i>Emma</i>,\\r\\nwhich has perhaps on the whole been the most general favourite, may\\r\\nchallenge that position on one ground beyond all question, though\\r\\npossibly not on all. It is the absolute triumph of that reliance on the\\r\\nstrictly ordinary which has been indicated as Miss Austen\\'s title to\\r\\npre-eminence in the history of the novel. Not an event, not a\\r\\ncircumstance, not a detail, is carried out of &quot;the daily round, the\\r\\ncommon task&quot; of average English middle-class humanity, upper and lower.\\r\\nYet every event, every circumstance, every detail, is put <i>sub specie\\r\\neternitatis</i> by the sorcery of art. Few things could be more\\r\\nterrible&mdash;nothing more tiresome&mdash;than to hear the garrulous Miss Bates\\r\\ntalk in actual life; few things are more delightful than to read her\\r\\nspeeches as they occur here. An aspiring soul might feel disposed to\\r\\n&quot;take and drown itself in a pail&quot; (as one of Dickens\\'s characters says)\\r\\nif it had to live the life which the inhabitants of Highbury are\\r\\nrepresented as living; to read about that life&mdash;to read about it over\\r\\nand over again&mdash;has been and is always likely to be one of the chosen\\r\\ndelights of some of the best wits of our race. This is one of the\\r\\nparadoxes of art: and perhaps it is the most wonderful of them,\\r\\nexceeding even the old &quot;pity and terror&quot; problem. And the discovery of\\r\\nit, as a possible source of artistic success, is one of the greatest\\r\\ntriumphs and one of the most inexhaustible discoveries of that art\\r\\nitself. For by another paradox&mdash;this time not of art but of nature&mdash;the\\r\\nextraordinary is exhaustible and the ordinary is not. Tragedy and the\\r\\nmore &quot;incidented&quot; comedy, it is well known, run into types and reproduce\\r\\nsituations almost inevitably. &quot;All the stories are told.&quot; But the story\\r\\nof the life of Highbury never can be told, <a name=\"Page_199\" id=\"Page_199\" />because there is really\\r\\nnothing in it but the telling: and here the blessed infinity of Art\\r\\ncomes in again.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Miss Austen\\'s last book, like her first, was published posthumously and\\r\\nshe left nothing else but a couple of fragments. One of these, <i>Lady\\r\\nSusan</i>, does not, so far as it extends, promise much, though it is such\\r\\na fragment and such an evident first draft even of this, that judgment\\r\\nof it is equally unfair and futile. The other, <i>The Watsons</i>, has some\\r\\nvery striking touches, but is also a mere beginning. <i>Persuasion</i>&mdash;which\\r\\nappeared with <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and which, curiously enough, has, like\\r\\nits nearly twenty years elder sister, Bath for its principal scene&mdash;has\\r\\nalso some pretensions to primacy among the books, and is universally\\r\\nadmitted to be of its author\\'s most delicate, most finished, and most\\r\\nsustained work. And this, like <i>Emma</i>, resolutely abstains from even the\\r\\nslightest infusion of startling or unusual incident, of &quot;exciting&quot;\\r\\nstory, of glaring colour of any kind: relying only on congruity of\\r\\nspeech, sufficient if subdued description, and above all a profusion of\\r\\nthe most delicately, but the most vividly drawn character, made to\\r\\nunfold a plot which has interest, if no excitement, and seasoned\\r\\nthroughout with the unfailing condiment&mdash;the author\\'s &quot;own sauce&quot;&mdash;of\\r\\ngentle but piquant irony and satire.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is not to be supposed or inferred that Miss Austen\\'s methods, or her\\r\\nresults, have appealed to everybody. Madame de Sta&euml;l thought her\\r\\n<i>vulgaire</i>&mdash;meaning, of course, not exactly our &quot;vulgar&quot; but\\r\\n&quot;commonplace&quot;; Charlotte Bront&euml; was not much otherwise minded; her own\\r\\nMarianne Dashwood would doubtless have thought the same. Readers without\\r\\nsome touch of letters may think her style old-fashioned: it has even\\r\\nbeen termed &quot;stilted.&quot; Not merely may amateurs of blood and thunder, of\\r\\npassion <a name=\"Page_200\" id=\"Page_200\" />and sensation, think her tame, but the more modern devotees of\\r\\n&quot;analysis&quot; may consider her superficial. On the other hand, it is\\r\\nnotorious that, from her own day to this, she has never wanted\\r\\npartisans, often of superlative competence, and of the most strikingly\\r\\ndifferent tempers, tastes, and opinions. The extraordinary quietness of\\r\\nher art is only matched by its confidence: its subtlety by its strength.\\r\\nShe did not try many styles; she deliberately and no doubt wisely\\r\\nrefused to try the other style which was already carrying all before it\\r\\nin her own later days. She seems to have confined herself (with what\\r\\nseems to some high-flying judges an almost ignoble caution) to the\\r\\nstrata of society that she knew most thoroughly: and the curious have\\r\\nnoted that she seldom goes above a baronet, and hardly even descends to\\r\\na butler, in her range of personages who are not mere mutes. It is not\\r\\nat all unlikely&mdash;in fact it is almost certain&mdash;that she might have\\r\\nenlarged this range, and that of her incident, with perfect safety and\\r\\nto the great profit and delight of her readers. But these actual things\\r\\nshe knew she could do consummately; and she would not risk the\\r\\nproduction of anything not consummate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The value of her, artistically, is of course in the perfection of what\\r\\nshe did; but the value of her historically is in the way in which she\\r\\nshowed that, given the treatment, any material could be perfected. It\\r\\nwas in this way, as has been pointed out, that the possibilities of the\\r\\nnovel were shown to be practically illimitable. Tragedy is not needed:\\r\\nand the most ordinary transactions, the most everyday characters,\\r\\ndevelop into an infinite series of comedies with which the novelist can\\r\\namuse himself and his readers. The <i>ludicrum humani seculi</i> on the one\\r\\nhand, and the artist\\'s power of extracting and arranging it on <a name=\"Page_201\" id=\"Page_201\" />the\\r\\nother&mdash;these two things supply all that is wanted. This Hampshire\\r\\nparson\\'s daughter had found the philosopher\\'s stone of the novel: and\\r\\nthe very pots and pans, the tongs and pokers of the house, could be\\r\\nturned into novel-gold by it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But even gold is not everything: and only a fanatic, and a rather\\r\\nfoolish fanatic, would say that this style of fiction summed up and\\r\\nexhausted all the good that fiction could give and do. Miss Austen\\'s art\\r\\nexcludes (it has been said) tragedy; it does not let in much pure\\r\\nromance; although its variety is in a way infinite, yet it is not\\r\\nvarious in infinite ways, but rather in very finite ones. Everybody who\\r\\ndenies its excellence is to be blamed: but nobody is to be blamed for\\r\\nsaying that he should like some other excellences as well. The desire is\\r\\ninnocent, nay commendable: and it was being satisfied, at practically\\r\\nthe same time, by the work of Sir Walter Scott in a kind of novel almost\\r\\nas new (when we regard it in connection with its earlier examples) as\\r\\nMiss Austen\\'s own. This was the Historical novel, which, in a way, not\\r\\nonly subsumed many though not quite all varieties of Romance, but also\\r\\nsummoned to its aid not a little&mdash;in fact a very great deal&mdash;of the\\r\\nmethods of the pure novel itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is not very long since a critic, probably not very old, sentenced the\\r\\ncritical opinions of another critic, certainly not very young, to &quot;go\\r\\ninto the melting pot&quot; because they were in favour of the historical\\r\\nnovel: and because the historical novel had for some time past done\\r\\ngreat harm (I think the phrase was stronger) to the imaginative\\r\\nliterature of England. Now there are several things which might be said\\r\\nabout this judgment&mdash;I do not say &quot;in arrest&quot; of it, because it is of\\r\\nitself inoperative: as it happens you cannot put critical opinions in\\r\\nthe melting <a name=\"Page_202\" id=\"Page_202\" />pot. At least, they won\\'t melt: and they come out again\\r\\nlike the diabolic rat that Mr. Chips tried to pitch-boil. In the first\\r\\nplace, there is the question whether the greater part by far of the\\r\\nimaginative and other literature of <i>any</i> time does not itself &quot;go into\\r\\nthe melting pot,&quot; and whether it much matters what sends it there. In\\r\\nthe second, if this seems too cynical, there is the very large and grave\\r\\nquestion whether a still larger proportion of the novel of manners, in\\r\\nEngland, France, and all other countries during the same time, has not\\r\\nbeen as bad as, or worse than, the romantic division, historical or\\r\\nother. But the worst faults of the judgment remain. In the first place\\r\\nthere is the fatal shortness of view. It is with the literature of two\\r\\nthousand, not with the literature of twenty, years that the true critic\\r\\nhas to do: and no kind which&mdash;in two thousand, or two hundred, or\\r\\ntwenty&mdash;has produced literature that is good or great can be even\\r\\ntemporarily put aside because (as every kind of literature without\\r\\nexception has been again and again) it is for a time barren or fruitful\\r\\nonly in weeds. And any one who does not count Scott and Dumas and\\r\\nThackeray among the makers of good literature must really excuse others\\r\\nif they simply take no further count of him. The historical novel is a\\r\\ngood kind, good friends, a marvellous good kind: and it has the\\r\\nadvantage over the pure novel of manners that it is much less subject to\\r\\nobsolescence, if it be really well done; while it can practically annex\\r\\nmost of the virtues of that novel of manners itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This excellent kind, however, had been wandering about in the\\r\\nwilderness&mdash;had indeed hardly got so far even as that stage, but had\\r\\nbeen a mere &quot;bodiless childful of life in the gloom&quot;&mdash;for more than two\\r\\nthousand years before <i>Waverley</i>. Of its earlier attempts to get into\\r\\nfull existence <a name=\"Page_203\" id=\"Page_203\" />we cannot say much here:<a id=\"footnotetag18\" name=\"footnotetag18\"></a><a href=\"#footnote18\"><sup>18</sup></a> something on the more\\r\\nrecent but rather abortive birth-throes has been promised, and is now\\r\\ndue. It is not improbable that considerable assistance was rendered to\\r\\nthe kind by the heroic romance of the seventeenth century in prose and\\r\\nverse, which often attempted historic, and almost always\\r\\npseudo-historic, guise. As has been seen in regard to such collections\\r\\nas Croxall\\'s, historical stories were freely mingled with fictitious:\\r\\nand it could not be for nothing that Horace Walpole, the author of the\\r\\n<i>Castle of Otranto</i>, was a rather ardent and even to some extent\\r\\nscholarly student of the romance and the gossip of history. Much\\r\\nearlier, Fielding himself, in his salad days, had given something of an\\r\\nhistoric turn to the story of <i>A Journey from this World to the Next</i>.\\r\\nAnd when history itself became more common and more readable, it could\\r\\nnot but be that this inexhaustible source of material for the new kind\\r\\nof literature, which was being so eagerly demanded and so busily\\r\\nsupplied, should suggest itself. Some instances of late eighteenth and\\r\\nearly nineteenth century experiments have been given and discussed in\\r\\nthe last chapter: and when Scott (or &quot;the Author of <i>Waverley</i>&quot;) had\\r\\nachieved his astonishing success, some of the writers of these put in\\r\\nthe usual claim of &quot;That\\'s <i>my</i> thunder.&quot; This was done in the case of\\r\\nthe Lees, it was also done in the case of Jane Porter, the writer of\\r\\nthe once famous and favourite <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i> (1803) and <i>Scottish\\r\\nChiefs</i> (1810): while, as we have seen, there had been historical colour\\r\\nenough in Godwin\\'s novels to <a name=\"Page_204\" id=\"Page_204\" />make suggestion of <i>his</i> &quot;authorship of\\r\\n<i>Waverley</i>&quot; not absolutely preposterous. Even Mrs. Radcliffe had touched\\r\\nthe style; and humbler persons like the egregious Henrietta Mosse had\\r\\nattempted it in the most serious spirit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But with their varying degrees of talent&mdash;with, in one or two cases,\\r\\neven a little genius&mdash;all these writers had broken themselves upon one\\r\\nfatal difficulty&mdash;that of anachronism: not in the petty sense of the\\r\\npedant, but in the wide one of the critic. The present writer is not\\r\\nprepared, without reading <i>A Peep at Our Ancestors</i> again (which he\\r\\ndistinctly declines to do), to say that there are, in that remarkable\\r\\nperformance, any positive errors of historic fact worse than, or as bad,\\r\\nas those which pedantry has pointed out in <i>Ivanhoe</i>. But whereas you\\r\\nmay be nearly as well acquainted with the actual history of the time as\\r\\nthe pedants themselves, and a great deal better acquainted with its\\r\\nliterature, and yet never be shocked, disgusted, or contemptuously\\r\\namused in <i>Ivanhoe</i> by such things as were quoted from the <i>Peep</i> a few\\r\\npages back&mdash;so, to those who know something of &quot;the old Elizabeth way,&quot;\\r\\nand even nowadays to those who know very little, and that little at\\r\\nsecond hand, Miss Lee\\'s travesty of it in <i>The Recess</i> is impossible and\\r\\nintolerable. When Mrs. Radcliffe, at the date definitely given of 1584,\\r\\ntalks about &quot;the Parisian opera,&quot; represents a French girl of the\\r\\nsixteenth century as being &quot;instructed in the English poets,&quot; and talks\\r\\nabout driving in a &quot;landau,&quot; the individual blunders are, perhaps, not\\r\\nmore violent than those of the chronology by which Scott\\'s Ulrica is\\r\\napparently a girl at the time of the Conquest and a woman, not too old\\r\\nto be the object of rivalry between Front de Boeuf and his father, not\\r\\nlong before the reign of Richard I. But this last oversight does not\\r\\naffect the credibility of the story, or the <a name=\"Page_205\" id=\"Page_205\" />homogeneity of the manners,\\r\\nin the least. Mrs. Radcliffe jumbles up two (or more than two) utterly\\r\\ndifferent states and stages of society, manners, and other things which\\r\\nconstitute the very atmosphere of the story itself. Perhaps (we have\\r\\nvery few easy conversations of the period to justify a positive\\r\\nstatement) a real Bois-Guilbert and still more a real Wamba might not\\r\\nhave talked exactly like Scott\\'s personages: but there is no insistent\\r\\nand disturbing reason why they should not. When we hear an Adelaise of\\r\\nthe mid-twelfth century asking whether she does not receive her\\r\\neducation from her mamma, the necessary &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;\\r\\nbecomes impossible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But these now most obvious truths were not obvious at all between 1780\\r\\nand 1810: and it is perhaps the greatest evidence of Scott\\'s genius that\\r\\nhalf, but by no means quite, unconsciously he saw them, and that he has\\r\\nmade everybody see them since. It was undoubtedly fortunate that he\\r\\nbegan novel-writing so late: for earlier even he might have been caught\\r\\nin the errors of the time. But when he did begin, he had not only\\r\\nreached middle life and matured his considerable original critical\\r\\nfaculty&mdash;criticism and wine are the only things that even the &quot;kind calm\\r\\nyears&quot; may be absolutely trusted to improve if there is any original\\r\\ngoodness in them&mdash;but he had other advantages. He had read, if not with\\r\\nminute accuracy, very widely indeed: and he possessed, as Lord Morley\\r\\nhas well said, &quot;the genius of history&quot; in a degree which perhaps no\\r\\nmerely meticulous scholar has ever reached, and which was not exceeded\\r\\nin <i>quality</i> even by the greatest historians such as Gibbon. He had an\\r\\nalmost unmatched combination of common sense with poetic imagination, of\\r\\nknowledge of the world with knowledge of letters. He had shown himself\\r\\nto be possessed of the secret of semi-historical <a name=\"Page_206\" id=\"Page_206\" />narrative itself in\\r\\nhalf a dozen remarkable verse romances, and therefore had less to do in\\r\\nengineering the prose romance. Last of all, he had seen what to\\r\\navoid&mdash;not merely in his editing of Strutt\\'s <i>Queenhoo Hall</i> (a valuable\\r\\nproperty-room for the novel, but nothing of a real novel), but in his\\r\\nreading of the failures of his predecessors and contemporaries. The very\\r\\nbeginning of <i>Waverley</i> itself (which most people skip) is invaluable,\\r\\nbecause it shows us that at the time he wrote it (which, it need hardly\\r\\nbe said, was a long time before its completion) he had not the knowledge\\r\\nor the courage to strike straight out into the stream of action and\\r\\nconversation, but troubled himself with accumulating bladders and\\r\\narranging ropes for the possible salvation of his narrative if it got\\r\\ninto difficulties. Very soon he knew that it would not get into\\r\\ndifficulties: and away he went.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It ought not to be necessary, but from some symptoms it may be\\r\\ndesirable, to point out that Scott is very far from being an historical\\r\\nnovelist only. An acute French critic, well acquainted with both\\r\\nliteratures, once went so far as to say that there were a good many\\r\\nprofessed &quot;philosophical&quot; novels which did not contain such keen\\r\\npsychology as Scott\\'s: and I would undertake to show a good deal of\\r\\ncause on this side. But short of it, it is undeniable that he can do\\r\\nperfectly well without any historical scaffolding. There is practically\\r\\nnothing of it in his second and third novels, <i>Guy Mannering</i> and <i>The\\r\\nAntiquary</i>, each of which good judges have sometimes ranked as his very\\r\\nbest: there is as little or less in <i>St. Ronan\\'s Well</i>, a very fine\\r\\nthing as it is, and one which, but for James Ballantyne\\'s meddling folly\\r\\nand prudery, would have been much finer. The incomparable little\\r\\nconversation&mdash;scenes and character-sketches scattered among the\\r\\nIntroductions to the novels&mdash;especially <a name=\"Page_207\" id=\"Page_207\" />the history of Crystal\\r\\nCroftangry&mdash;show that he could perfectly well have dispensed with all\\r\\nout-of-the-way incident had he chosen. But, as a rule, he did not so\\r\\nchoose: and, in the majority of cases, he preferred to take his\\r\\nout-of-the-way incident from historical sources. Not here,\\r\\nunfortunately, can we allow ourselves even a space proportionate to that\\r\\ngiven above in Miss Austen\\'s case to the criticism of individual novels:\\r\\nbut luckily there is not much need of this. The brilliant overture of\\r\\n<i>Waverley</i> as such, with its entirely novel combination of the\\r\\nhistorical and the &quot;national&quot; elements upon the still more novel\\r\\nbackground of Highland scenery; the equally vivid and vigorous narrative\\r\\nand the more interesting personages of <i>Old Mortality</i> and <i>Rob Roy</i>;\\r\\nthe domestic tragedy, with the historical element for little more than a\\r\\nframework, of the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i> and the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>;\\r\\nthe little masterpiece of <i>A Legend of Montrose</i>; the fresh departure,\\r\\nwith purely English subject, of <i>Ivanhoe</i> and its triumphant sequels in\\r\\n<i>Kenilworth, Quentin Durward</i>, and others; the striking utilisation of\\r\\nliterary assistance in the <i>Fortunes of Nigel</i>; and the wonderful\\r\\nblending of autobiographic, historical, and romantic interest in\\r\\n<i>Redgauntlet</i>:&mdash;one cannot dwell on these and other things. The magic\\r\\ncontinued even in <i>Woodstock</i>&mdash;written as this was almost between the\\r\\nblows of the executioner\\'s crow-bar on the wheel, in the tightening of\\r\\nthe windlasses at the rack&mdash;it is not absent, whatever people may say,\\r\\nin <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>, nor even quite lacking in the better parts of\\r\\n<i>Count Robert of Paris</i>. But we must not expatiate on its effects; we\\r\\nmust only give a little attention to the means by which they are\\r\\nachieved.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Another of the common errors about Scott is to represent&mdash;perhaps really\\r\\nto regard&mdash;him as a hit-or-miss and <a name=\"Page_208\" id=\"Page_208\" />hand-to-mouth <i>improvisatore</i>, who\\r\\nbundled out his creations anyhow, and did not himself know how he\\r\\ncreated them. The fallacy is worse than a fallacy: for it is down-right\\r\\nfalse witness. We have numerous passages in and out of the novels&mdash;the\\r\\nchief of them being the remarkable conversation with Captain Clutterbuck\\r\\nin the Introduction to the <i>Fortunes of Nigel</i> and the reflections in\\r\\nthe <i>Diary</i> on <i>Sir John Chiverton</i> and <i>Brambletye House</i>&mdash;showing that\\r\\nScott knew perfectly well the construction and the stringing of his\\r\\nfiddle, as well as the trick of applying his rosin. But if we had not\\r\\nthese direct testimonies, no one of any critical faculty could mistake\\r\\nthe presence of consciously perceived principles in the books\\r\\nthemselves. A man does not suddenly, and by mere blind instinct, avoid\\r\\nsuch a pitfall as that of incongruous speech and manners, which has been\\r\\nnoticed above. It is not mere happy-go-lucky blundering which makes him\\r\\ninvariably decline another into which people still fall&mdash;the selection\\r\\nof historical personages of the first importance, and elaborately known,\\r\\nfor the <i>central</i> figures of his novels. Not to believe in luck is a\\r\\nmark of perhaps greater folly than to over-believe in it: but luck will\\r\\nnot always keep a man clear of such perils as that unskilful wedging of\\r\\ngreat blocks of mere history into his story, which the lesser historical\\r\\nnovelists always commit, or that preponderance of mere narrative itself\\r\\nas compared with action and conversation from which even Dumas, even\\r\\nThackeray, is not free.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That he knew what he was doing and what he had to do is thus certain;\\r\\nthat he did it to an astounding extent is still more certain; but it\\r\\nwould not skill much to deny that he did not always give himself time to\\r\\ndo it perfectly in every respect, though it is perhaps not mere paradox\\r\\nor mere partisanship to suggest that if he had given him<a name=\"Page_209\" id=\"Page_209\" />self more time,\\r\\nhe would hardly have done better, and might have done worse. The\\r\\naccusation of superficiality has been <i>already</i> glanced at: and it is\\r\\npretty certain that it argues more superficiality, of a much more\\r\\nhopeless kind, in those who make it. The accusation of careless and\\r\\nslovenly style is not much better: for Scott had, perfectly, the style\\r\\nsuited to his own work, and you cannot easily have a better style than\\r\\nthat. But there are two defects in him which were early detected by good\\r\\nand friendly judges: and which are in fact natural results of the\\r\\nextraordinary force and fertility of his creative power. One&mdash;the less\\r\\nserious, but certainly to some extent a fault in art and a point in\\r\\nwhich he is distinguished for the worse from Shakespeare&mdash;is that he is\\r\\nrather given to allow at first, to some of his personages, an\\r\\nelaborateness and apparent emphasis of drawing which seems to promise an\\r\\nimportance for them in the story that they never actually attain. Mike\\r\\nLambourne in <i>Kenilworth</i> is a good example of this: but there are many\\r\\nothers. The fact evidently was that, in the rush of the artist\\'s plastic\\r\\nimagination, other figures rose and overpowered these. It is an excuse:\\r\\nbut it is hardly a justification. The other and more serious is a\\r\\ntendency&mdash;which grew on him and may no doubt have been encouraged by the\\r\\nastonishing pecuniary rewards of his work&mdash;to hurry his conclusions, to\\r\\n&quot;huddle up the cards and throw them into the bag,&quot; as Lady Louisa Stuart\\r\\ntold him. There is one of the numerous, but it would seem generic and\\r\\nclassifiable, forms of unpleasant dream in which the dreamer\\'s watch, to\\r\\nhis consternation, suddenly begins to send its hands round at double and\\r\\nten-fold speed. Scott is rather apt to do this, towards the close of his\\r\\nnovels, in his eagerness to begin something else. These defects,\\r\\nhowever, are defects much more from <a name=\"Page_210\" id=\"Page_210\" />the point of view of abstract\\r\\ncriticism than from that of the pleasure of the reader: while, even from\\r\\nthe former, they are outweighed many times by merits. And as regards our\\r\\npresent method of estimation, they hardly count at all.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For, in that calculus, the important thing is that Scott, like Miss\\r\\nAusten, at once opened an immense new field to the novelist, and showed\\r\\nhow that field was to be cultivated. The complement-contrast of the pair\\r\\ncan need emphasising only to those on whom no emphasis would be likely\\r\\nto impress it: but it may not be quite so evident at once that between\\r\\nthem they cover almost the entire possible ground of prose fiction. The\\r\\nmore striking and popular as well as more strictly novel style of Scott\\r\\nnaturally attracted most attention at first: indeed it can hardly be\\r\\nsaid that, for the next thirty years, much attempt was made to follow in\\r\\nMiss Austen\\'s steps, while such attempts as were made were seldom very\\r\\ngood.<a id=\"footnotetag19\" name=\"footnotetag19\"></a><a href=\"#footnote19\"><sup>19</sup></a> But there is no need to hurry Time: and he generally knows\\r\\nwhat he is about. At any rate he had, in and through these two\\r\\nprovided&mdash;for generations, probably for centuries, to come&mdash;patterns and\\r\\nprinciples for whoso would to follow in prose fiction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_VI\" id=\"CHAPTER_VI\" /><a name=\"Page_211\" id=\"Page_211\" />CHAPTER VI</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>THE SUCCESSORS&mdash;TO THACKERAY</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A person inexperienced in the ways of life and literature might expect\\r\\nthat such developments as those surveyed and discussed in the last\\r\\nchapter must have immediate and unbroken development further. Scott had\\r\\nthrown open, and made available, the whole vast range of history for the\\r\\nromancer: Miss Austen had shown the infinite possibilities of ordinary\\r\\nand present things for the novelist. And such a one might contend that,\\r\\neven if the common idea of definite precursorship and teachership be a\\r\\nmistake, the more subtle doctrine that such work as Scott\\'s, and as Miss\\r\\nAusten\\'s, is really the result of generally working forces, as well as\\r\\nof individual genius, would lead to the same conclusion. But the\\r\\nexpectation would show his inexperience, and his ignorance of the fact\\r\\nthat Art, unlike Science, declines to be bound by any calculable laws\\r\\nwhatsoever.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It was indeed impossible that Scott\\'s towering fame should not draw the\\r\\nnobler sort, and his immense gains the baser, to follow in his track:\\r\\nand they promptly did so. But, as he himself quoted in the remarkable\\r\\ncomments (above alluded to) on his early imitators in the <i>Diary</i>, they\\r\\nhad &quot;gotten his fiddle, but not his rosin&quot;&mdash;an observation the truth of\\r\\nwhich may be shown presently. Miss Austen\\'s immediate influence in the\\r\\nother direction was almost <i>nil</i>: and this was hardly to be regretted,\\r\\nbecause a tolerably stationary state of manners, language, <a name=\"Page_212\" id=\"Page_212\" />etc., such\\r\\nas her kind of novel requires, had not quite, though it had nearly, been\\r\\nreached. At any rate, the kind of ebb or half ebb, which so often,\\r\\nthough not so certainly, follows flood-tides in literature, came upon\\r\\nthe novel in the twenties and thirties. Even the striking appearance of\\r\\nDickens and <i>Pickwick</i> in 1837 can hardly be said to have turned it\\r\\ndistinctly: for the Dickensian novel is a species by itself&mdash;neither\\r\\nstrictly novel nor strictly romance, but, as Polonius might say, a\\r\\npicaresque-burlesque-sentimental-farcical-realist-fantastic nondescript.\\r\\nNot till <i>Vanity Fair</i> did the novel of pure real life advance its\\r\\nstandard once more: while the historical novel-romance of a new kind may\\r\\ndate its revival with&mdash;though it should scarcely trace that revival\\r\\nto&mdash;<i>Esmond</i>, or <i>Westward Ho!</i> or both.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Between Scott on the earlier side and Dickens and Thackeray on the\\r\\nother, there was an immense production of novels, illustrated by not a\\r\\nfew names which should rank high in the second class, while some would\\r\\npromote more than one of them to the first. The lines of development, as\\r\\nwell as the chief individual practitioners, may be best indicated by\\r\\nshort discussions of Hook, Bulwer, Disraeli, Ainsworth, James, Marryat,\\r\\nand Peacock.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The most probable demur to this list is likely to be taken at the very\\r\\nfirst name. Theodore Hook has had no return of the immense popularity\\r\\nwhich his <i>Sayings and Doings</i> (1826-1829) obtained for him; nor,\\r\\nperhaps, is he ever likely to have any; nor yet, further, save in one\\r\\nrespect, can he be said to deserve it. Flimsily constructed, hastily\\r\\nwritten, reflecting indeed the ways and speech of the time after a\\r\\nfashion, but in a distorted mirror and with a thin and superficial\\r\\nrepresentation, nearer to bad drama than to good literature, full of\\r\\nhorseplay and forced high jinks&mdash;his <a name=\"Page_213\" id=\"Page_213\" />stories have all the inseparable\\r\\nfaults of improvisation together with those of art that is out of\\r\\nfashion and manners-painting (such as it is) of manners that are dead,\\r\\nand when alive were those of a not very picturesque, pleasing, or\\r\\nrespectable transition. Yet, for all this, Hook has a claim on the\\r\\ncritical historian of literature, and especially of the novel, which has\\r\\nbeen far too little acknowledged. And this claim does not even consist\\r\\nin the undoubted fact that his influence both on Dickens and on\\r\\nThackeray was direct and very great. It lies in the larger and more\\r\\nimportant, though connected, fact that, at a given moment, his were the\\r\\nhands in which the torch of the novel-procession was deposited. He\\r\\nstands to fiction almost exactly as Leigh Hunt stands to the\\r\\nmiscellaneous essay. He modernised and multiplied its subjects,\\r\\nattractions, appeals: he &quot;vulgarised&quot; it in the partly good French\\r\\nsense, as well as in the wholly bad English one; he was its journalist\\r\\nand <i>colporteur</i>. He broke up the somewhat stock-and-type moulds of\\r\\neighteenth-century tale-telling; admitted a plurality, almost an\\r\\ninfinity, of interest and incident; gave a sort of universal franchise\\r\\nto possible subjects of novel; and (perhaps most important of all)\\r\\nbanished from that novel the tendency to conventional &quot;lingo&quot; which,\\r\\nthough never so prevalent in it as in eighteenth-century drama, had\\r\\nexisted. It may seem to some readers that there is an exaggerated and\\r\\nparadoxical opposition between this high praise and the severe censure\\r\\npronounced a little above&mdash;that both cannot be true. But both are true:\\r\\nand it is a really natural and necessary cause and proof at once of\\r\\ntheir truth that Hook never wrote a really good novel, hardly even a\\r\\nreally good tale (&quot;Gervase Skinner&quot; is probably the best), and yet that\\r\\nhe deserves the place here given to him.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_214\" id=\"Page_214\" />Ainsworth and James perhaps deserve to be taken next, not so much in\\r\\npoint of merit as because both, though continuing (especially Ainsworth)\\r\\nvery late, began pretty early. Indeed, a book in which Ainsworth had a\\r\\nhand, though it is said to be not wholly his, <i>Sir John Chiverton</i>, was\\r\\nwith Horace Smith\\'s <i>Brambletye House</i> (1826), the actual subject of\\r\\nScott\\'s criticism above quoted. Both Ainsworth and James are unconcealed\\r\\nfollowers of Scott himself: and they show the dangers to which the\\r\\nhistorical romance is exposed when it gets out of the hands of genius.\\r\\nOf the two, James had the greater scholarship, the better command of\\r\\nEnglish, and perhaps a nearer approach to command also of character:\\r\\nAinsworth more &quot;fire in his interior,&quot; more variety, somewhat more\\r\\nhumour (though neither was strong in this respect), and a certain not\\r\\nuseless or despicable faculty of splashy scene-painting and rough but\\r\\nnot ineffective stage-management. But of Scott\\'s combination of poetry,\\r\\nhumour, knowledge of life, reading, grasp of character, and command of\\r\\neffective dialogue and description, both were utterly destitute: and\\r\\nboth fell into the mistake (which even Dumas did not wholly avoid) of\\r\\nattempting to give the historical effect by thrusting in lardings of\\r\\npure history, by overloading descriptions of dress, etc., and, in short,\\r\\nby plastering the historic colour on, instead of suffusing it, as Scott\\r\\nhad managed to do. Popular as they were, not merely with youthful\\r\\nreaders, they undoubtedly brought the historical novel into some\\r\\ndiscredit a little before the middle of the century.<a id=\"footnotetag20\" name=\"footnotetag20\"></a><a href=\"#footnote20\"><sup>20</sup></a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With Bulwer and Disraeli we get into a different sphere <a name=\"Page_215\" id=\"Page_215\" />of\\r\\nliterature&mdash;whether into the same in both cases, and whether, if so,\\r\\ninto one of the highest, are questions on which no general agreement has\\r\\nyet been reached&mdash;on which, perhaps, no general agreement is even\\r\\npossible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With regard to the second, it must be remembered that to him, whether as\\r\\nMr. Disraeli or as Lord Beaconsfield, novel-writing was always a\\r\\n&quot;by-work&quot;&mdash;partly a means to his real end of politics, partly a\\r\\nrelaxation from the work necessary to that end. He called himself a\\r\\n&quot;gentleman of the press&quot;&mdash;with that mixture of sincerity, purpose, and\\r\\nironical simulation which brought on him, from unintelligent or not very\\r\\nhonest opponents, and even from others, the charge of affectation, if\\r\\nnot of hypocrisy. And, undoubtedly, he did a good deal of work for the\\r\\npress, and very remarkable work too&mdash;almost wholly in the kind of\\r\\nnovel-writing, from <i>Vivian Grey</i> (1826) to <i>Endymion</i> (1880). Yet it\\r\\nmay be permitted&mdash;in the face of some more than respectable opinion on\\r\\nthe other side&mdash;to doubt whether, except in some curious sports and\\r\\nby-products, he ever produced real novel-work of the highest class. In\\r\\nthe satiric-fantastic tale&mdash;in a kind of following of Voltaire&mdash;such as\\r\\n<i>Ixion</i>, he has hardly a superior, unless it be Anthony Hamilton, who is\\r\\nthe superior of Voltaire himself and the master of everybody. For a pure\\r\\nlove-novel of a certain kind, <i>Henrietta Temple</i> (1837) is bad to\\r\\nbeat&mdash;and in a curious cross between the historical, biographical, and\\r\\nthe romantic, <i>Venetia</i> (same year) also stands pretty much alone. But\\r\\nall the rest, more or less political, more or less &quot;of society,&quot; more or\\r\\nless fantastic&mdash;<i>Coningsby</i> (1844) as well as <i>Alroy</i> (1833), <i>Tancred</i>\\r\\n(1847) as well as <i>Vivian Grey, Sybil</i> (1845), as well as <i>The Young\\r\\nDuke</i> (1831), &quot;leave to desire&quot; in a strange way. Like the three which\\r\\nhave been excepted for praise, each is in a manner <i>sui <a name=\"Page_216\" id=\"Page_216\" />generis</i>, while\\r\\nthe whole group stands, in a manner also, apart from others and by\\r\\nitself. There is astonishing cleverness everywhere, in regard to almost\\r\\nevery point of novel-composition, though with special regard to\\r\\nepigrammatic phrase. But the whole is <i>inorganic</i> somehow, and more than\\r\\nsomehow unreal; without (save in the cases mentioned) attaining that\\r\\nobviously unreal but persuasive phantasmagoria which some great writers\\r\\nof fiction have managed to put in existence and motion. How far this is\\r\\ndue to the fact that most of the novels are political is a question\\r\\nrather to be hinted than to be discussed. But the present writer has\\r\\nnever read a political novel, whether on his own side or on others, that\\r\\nseemed to him to be wholly satisfactory.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Bulwer&mdash;for it is perhaps here not impolite or improper still to call\\r\\nthe first Lord Lytton by the name under which he wrote for forty years,\\r\\nand solidly niched himself in the novel-front of the minster of English\\r\\nLiterature&mdash;had not a few points of resemblance to his rival and future\\r\\nchief. But their relations to politics and letters were reversed.\\r\\nDisraeli was a born politician who was also a very considerable man of\\r\\nletters: Bulwer was a born man of letters who was a by no means\\r\\ninconsiderable politician. His literary ability was extraordinarily\\r\\ndiversified: but, once more, he was (here also) a born novelist, who was\\r\\nalso a not inconsiderable dramatist; a critic who might not impossibly\\r\\nhave been great, a miscellanist of ability, and a verse-writer than whom\\r\\nmany a worse has somehow or other obtained the name of poet. He began\\r\\nnovel-writing very early (<i>Falkland</i> is of 1827), he continued it all\\r\\nhis life, and he was the very Proteus-chameleon of the novel in changing\\r\\nhis styles to suit the tastes of the day. He never exactly copied\\r\\nanybody: and in all his various attempts <a name=\"Page_217\" id=\"Page_217\" />he went extremely near to the\\r\\nconstruction of masterpieces. In the novel of society with <i>Pelham</i>\\r\\n(1828); the novel of crime with <i>Eugene Aram</i> (1832) and <i>Zanoni</i>\\r\\n(1842); the novel of passion and a sort of mystery with <i>Ernest\\r\\nMaltravers</i> and <i>Alice</i>; the historic romance with <i>The Last Days of\\r\\nPompeii</i> (1834), <i>The Last of the Barons</i> (1843), and <i>Harold</i> (1848),\\r\\nhe made marks deep and early. When the purely domestic kind came in he\\r\\nmade them, earlier and deeper still, with <i>The Caxtons</i> (1850), <i>My\\r\\nNovel</i> (1853), etc. He caught the &quot;sensation&quot; ball at nearly its first\\r\\nservice with his old &quot;mystery&quot; racket, and played the most brilliant\\r\\ngame of the whole tournament in <i>A Strange Story</i> (1862). At the last he\\r\\ntried later kinds still in books like <i>The Coming Race</i> (1871), <i>The\\r\\nParisians</i> (1873), and <i>Kenelm Chillingly</i>. And once, Pallas being kind,\\r\\nhe did an almost perfect thing (there is not a speck or a flaw in it\\r\\nexcept, perhaps, the mechanical death of the bulldog) and produced one\\r\\nof the best examples of one of the best and oldest classes of fiction\\r\\nknown to the world, in the ghost-story of <i>The Haunted and the Haunters</i>\\r\\n(1859).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Such a mass, such a length, such a variety of production, with so many\\r\\nmerits in it, would be difficult to meet elsewhere in our department.\\r\\nAnd yet very few critics of unquestionable competence, if any, have\\r\\naccorded the absolute First Class to Lord Lytton as a novelist. That\\r\\nthis is partly (and rather unjustly) due to the singular and sometimes\\r\\npositively ridiculous grandiloquence and to the half-mawkish,\\r\\nhalf-rancid, sentimentality which too often mar his earlier novels is\\r\\nprobably true. But it is not all the truth: if it were, it would be\\r\\nalmost sufficient to point out that he outgrew the first of these faults\\r\\ncompletely, the second almost completely; and that from <i>The Caxtons</i>\\r\\n(1850) onward there is hardly any stain on his literary <a name=\"Page_218\" id=\"Page_218\" />character in\\r\\nany such respect. But other faults&mdash;or at least defects&mdash;remain. They\\r\\nmay be almost summed up in the charge of want of <i>consummateness</i>.\\r\\nBulwer could be romantic&mdash;but his romance had the touch of bad taste and\\r\\ninsincerity referred to above. He could, as in <i>The Caxtons</i>, be fairly\\r\\ntrue to ordinary life&mdash;but even then he seemed to feel a necessity of\\r\\nsetting off and as it were apologising for the simplicity and veracity\\r\\nby touches&mdash;in fact by <i>douches</i>&mdash;of Sternian fantastry, and by other\\r\\ntouches of what was a little later to be called sensationalism. Even his\\r\\nhandling of the supernatural, which was undoubtedly a strong point of\\r\\nhis, was not wholly <i>de ban aloi</i>. To pronounce him, as was once done by\\r\\nan acute and amiable judge, &quot;the <i>hum</i>miest of <i>bugs</i>&quot; was excessive in\\r\\nlife, and would be preposterous in literature. But there undoubtedly\\r\\nwas, with rare exceptions, a suspicion of what is called in slang\\r\\n&quot;faking&quot; about his work. The wine is not &quot;neat&quot; but doctored; the\\r\\ncomposition is <i>pastiche</i>; a dozen other metaphors&mdash;of stucco, veneer,\\r\\nglueing-up&mdash;suggest themselves. And then there suggests itself, in turn,\\r\\na sort of shame at such imputations on the author of such a mass of\\r\\nwork, so various, so interesting, so important as accomplishment,\\r\\nsymptom, and pattern at once. And perhaps one may end by pronouncing\\r\\nBulwer one of the very greatest of English novelists who are not of the\\r\\nvery greatest.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is difficult to say whether the usual attitude of criticism to\\r\\nCaptain Marryat (1792-1848) is more uncritical than ungrateful or more\\r\\nungrateful than uncritical. Because he has amused the boy, it seems to\\r\\nbe taken for granted that he ought not to amuse the man: because he does\\r\\nnot write with the artificial and often extremely arbitrary graces of\\r\\nthe composition books, that he is &quot;not literature.&quot;<a name=\"Page_219\" id=\"Page_219\" /> If it be so, why in\\r\\nthe first case so much the worse for &quot;the man,&quot; and in the second so\\r\\nmuch the worse for literature. As a matter of fact, he has many of the\\r\\nqualities of the novelist in a high degree: and if he were in the\\r\\nfortunate position of an ancient classic, whose best works only survive,\\r\\nthese qualities could not fail of recognition. Much of his later work\\r\\nsimply ought not to count; for it was mere hack-labour, rendered, if not\\r\\nnecessary, very nearly so by the sailor\\'s habit (which Marryat possessed\\r\\nin the highest degree) of getting rid of money. Even among this,\\r\\n<i>Masterman Ready</i> and <i>The Children of the New Forest</i>, &quot;children\\'s\\r\\nbooks,&quot; as they may be called, rank very high in their kind. But he\\r\\ncounts here, of course, for his sea-novels mainly: and in them there are\\r\\nseveral things for us to notice. One is that Marryat had the true\\r\\nquality of the craftsman, as distinguished from the amateur or the\\r\\nchance-medley man who has a lucky inspiration. If it were the case that\\r\\nhis books derived their whole attraction from the novelty and (within\\r\\nits limits) the variety of their sea-matter, then the first ought to be\\r\\nthe best, as in nearly all such cases is the fact. But <i>Frank Mildmay</i>\\r\\n(1829), so far from being the best, is not far from being the worst of\\r\\nMarryat\\'s novels. Much&mdash;dangerously much&mdash;as he put of his own\\r\\nexperiences in the book, he did not know in the least how to manage\\r\\nthem. And if Frank is something of a bravo, more of a blackguard, and\\r\\nnearly a complete ruffian, it is not merely because there was a good\\r\\ndeal of brutality in the old navy; not merely because Marryat\\'s own\\r\\nstandard of chivalry was not quite that of Chaucer\\'s Knight:&mdash;but\\r\\npartly, also, because he was aiming blunderingly at what he supposed to\\r\\nbe part of the novelist\\'s business&mdash;irregular as well as regular\\r\\ngallantry, and highly seasoned adventure. But, like all good artists\\r\\n(and like hardly anybody who <a name=\"Page_220\" id=\"Page_220\" />has not the artistic quality in him), he\\r\\ntaught himself by his failure, even though he sometimes relapsed. Of\\r\\nactual construction he was never a master. <i>The King\\'s Own</i>, with its\\r\\noverdose of history at the beginning and of melodrama at the end, is an\\r\\nexample. But his two masterpieces, <i>Peter Simple</i> (1834) and <i>Mr.\\r\\nMidshipman Easy</i> (1836), are capital instances of what may be called\\r\\n&quot;particularist&quot; fiction&mdash;the fiction that derives its special zest from\\r\\nthe &quot;colours&quot; of some form of life unfamiliar to those who have not\\r\\nactually lived it. Even <i>Peter Simple</i> is unduly weighted at the end by\\r\\nthe machinations of Peter\\'s uncle against him and, at intervals during\\r\\nthe book, by the proceedings connected therewith. But <i>Mr. Midshipman\\r\\nEasy</i> is flawless&mdash;except for the amiable but surely excessive\\r\\nsentimentalists who are shocked at the way in which Mr. Easy <i>p&egrave;re</i>\\r\\nquits the greater stage by mounting the lesser. Than this book there is\\r\\nnot a better novel of special &quot;humour&quot; in literature; as much may be\\r\\nsaid of the greater part of <i>Peter Simple</i>, of not a little in <i>Jacob\\r\\nFaithful</i> (a great favourite with Thackeray, who always did justice to\\r\\nMarryat), and <i>Japhet in Search of a Father</i>, and of something in almost\\r\\nall. Nor were high jinks and special naval matters by any means\\r\\nMarryat\\'s only province. Laymen may agree with experts in thinking the\\r\\nclubhauling of the <i>Diom&egrave;de</i> in <i>Peter Simple</i>, and the two great fights\\r\\nof the <i>Aurora</i> with the elements and with the Russian frigate in <i>Mr.\\r\\nMidshipman Easy</i>, to be extraordinarily fine things:&mdash;vivid, free from\\r\\nextravagance, striking, stirring, clear, as descriptive and narrative\\r\\nliterature of the kind can be only at its best, and too seldom is at\\r\\nall. An almost Defoe-like exactness of detail is one of Marryat\\'s\\r\\nmethods and merits: while it is very remarkable that he rarely attempts\\r\\nto produce the fun, in which Defoe <a name=\"Page_221\" id=\"Page_221\" />is lacking and he himself so\\r\\nfertile, by mere exaggeration or caricature of detail. There are\\r\\nexceptions&mdash;the Dominie business in <i>Jacob Faithful</i> is one&mdash;but they\\r\\nare exceptions. Take Hook, his immediate predecessor, and no doubt in a\\r\\nway his model, as (it has been said) Hook was to almost everybody at the\\r\\ntime; take even Dickens, his fellow-pupil with Hook and his own greater\\r\\nsuccessor; and you will find that Marryat resorts less than either to\\r\\nthe humour of simple <i>charge</i> or exaggeration.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The last name on our present list belongs to the class of &quot;eccentric&quot;\\r\\nnovelists&mdash;the adjective being used, not in its transferred and partly\\r\\nimproper sense so much as in its true one. Peacock never plays the\\r\\nJack-pudding like Sterne: and his shrewd wit never permits him the\\r\\nsincere aberrations of Amory. But his work is out of the ordinary\\r\\ncourses, and does not turn round the ordinary centres of novel writing.\\r\\nIt belongs to the tradition&mdash;if to any tradition at all&mdash;of Lucian and\\r\\nthe Lucianists&mdash;especially as that tradition was redirected by Anthony\\r\\nHamilton. It thus comes, in one way, near part of the work of Disraeli;\\r\\nthough, except in point of satiric temper, its spirit is totally\\r\\ndifferent. Peacock was essentially a scholar (though a non-academic one)\\r\\nand essentially a humorist. In the progress of his books from <i>Headlong\\r\\nHall</i> (1816) to <i>Gryll Grange</i> (1860)&mdash;the last separated from the group\\r\\nto which the first belongs by more than twice as many years as were\\r\\ncovered by that group itself&mdash;he mellowed his tone, but altered his\\r\\nscheme very little. Except in <i>Maid Marian</i> and <i>The Misfortunes of\\r\\nElphin</i>, where the Scott influence is evident, though Peacock was\\r\\nhimself a rebel to Scott, the plan is always the same. <i>Headlong Hall</i>\\r\\nand <i>Nightmare Abbey, Melincourt</i> and <i>Crotchet Castle</i> (1831), as well\\r\\nas <i>Gryll Grange</i> itself, all have <a name=\"Page_222\" id=\"Page_222\" />the uniform, though by no means\\r\\nmonotonous, canvas of a party of guests assembled at a country-house and\\r\\nconsisting of a number of &quot;originals,&quot; with one or more common-sense but\\r\\nby no means commonplace characters to serve as contrast. It is in the\\r\\nselection and management of these foils that one of Peacock\\'s principal\\r\\ndistinctions lies. In his earlier books, and in accordance with the\\r\\nmanners of the time, there is a good deal of &quot;high jinks&quot;&mdash;less later.\\r\\nIn all, there is also a good deal of personal and literary satire, which\\r\\ntones and mellows as it proceeds. At first Peacock is extremely unjust\\r\\nto the Lake poets&mdash;so unjust indeed as to be sometimes hardly\\r\\namusing&mdash;to the two universities (of which it so happened that he was\\r\\nnot a member), to the Tory party generally, to clergymen, to other\\r\\nthings and persons. In <i>Crotchet Castle</i> the progress of Reform was\\r\\nalready beginning to produce a beneficent effect of reaction upon him,\\r\\nand in <i>Gryll Grange</i>, though the manners and cast are surprisingly\\r\\nmodern, the whole tone is conservative&mdash;with a small if not even with a\\r\\nlarge C&mdash;for the most prominent and well treated character is a\\r\\nChurchman of the best academic Tory type.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is not, however, in anything yet mentioned that Peacock\\'s charm\\r\\nconsists, so much as in the intensely literary, but not in the least\\r\\npedantic, tone with which he suffuses his books, the piquant but not in\\r\\nthe least affected turn of the phrases that meet us throughout, the\\r\\npeculiar quality of his irony (most quintessenced in <i>The Misfortunes of\\r\\nElphin</i>, which is different in scheme from the rest, but omnipresent),\\r\\nand the crisp presentation of individual scene, incident, and character\\r\\nof a kind. Story, in the general sense, there is none, or next to\\r\\nnone&mdash;the personages meet, go through a certain number of dinners\\r\\n(Peacock is <a name=\"Page_223\" id=\"Page_223\" />great at eating and drinking), diversions, and\\r\\ndifficulties, marry to a greater or less extent, but otherwise part. Yet\\r\\nsuch things as the character of Scythrop in <i>Nightmare Abbey</i> (a half\\r\\nfantastic, half faithful portrait of Shelley, who was Peacock\\'s intimate\\r\\nfriend), or of Dr. Folliott (a genial parson) in <i>Crotchet Castle</i>&mdash;as\\r\\nthe brilliant picture of the breaking of the dyke in <i>Elphin</i>, or the\\r\\ncomic one of the rotten-borough election in <i>Melincourt</i>&mdash;are among the\\r\\ntriumphs of the English novel. And they are present by dozens and\\r\\nscores: while (though it is a little out of our way) there is no doubt\\r\\nthat the attraction of the books is greatly enhanced by the abundance of\\r\\ninset verse&mdash;sometimes serious, more often light&mdash;of which Peacock,\\r\\nagain in an eccentric fashion, was hardly less a master than he was of\\r\\nprose.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Here also it has seemed fit to dwell on a single writer, not perhaps\\r\\ngenerally held to be of the absolutely first class, because these\\r\\n&quot;eccentrics&quot; are of very great importance in the history of the English\\r\\nnovel. The danger of the kind&mdash;even more than of other literary\\r\\nkinds&mdash;lies in the direction of mould and mechanism&mdash;of the production,\\r\\nby the thousand, of things of no individual quality and character. This\\r\\ndanger has been and is being amply exemplified. But the Peacocks (would\\r\\nthe plural were more justified!) save us from it by their own\\r\\nunconquerable individuality in the first place and, in the second, by\\r\\nthe fact that even the best in this kind is &quot;caviare to the general,&quot;\\r\\nwhile anything that is not the best has no attraction either for the\\r\\ngeneral or the elect. They are, as it were, the salt of the novel-feast,\\r\\nin more senses than one: and it is cause for thankfulness that, in this\\r\\nrespect as in the physical, England has been well off for salt-pits.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Besides these individual names&mdash;which in most litera<a name=\"Page_224\" id=\"Page_224\" />tures would be\\r\\ngreat, and even in English literature are not small&mdash;the second quarter\\r\\nof the century added to the history of the novel an infinity of others\\r\\nwho can hardly appear here even on the representative or selective\\r\\nsystem. All the suns of the novel hitherto mentioned had moons and stars\\r\\naround them; all the <i>cadres</i> of the various kinds were filled with\\r\\nprivates and non-commissioned officers to follow the leaders. Gait and\\r\\nMoir carried out the &quot;Scotch novel&quot; with something of Scott, but more of\\r\\nSmollett (Gait at least certainly, in part of his work, preceded Scott).\\r\\nLady Morgan, who has been mentioned already, Banim, Crofton Croker, and\\r\\nothers played a similar part to Miss Edgeworth. Glascock, Chamier, and\\r\\nHoward were, as it were, lieutenants (the last directly so) to Marryat.\\r\\nThe didactic side of Miss Edgeworth was taken up by Harriet Martineau.\\r\\nMrs. Shelley\\'s <i>Frankenstein</i> (1818) is among the latest good examples\\r\\nof the &quot;Terror&quot; class, to which her husband had contributed two of its\\r\\nworst, and two of the feeblest books ever written by a man of the\\r\\ngreatest genius, in <i>Zastrozzi</i> and <i>St. Irvyne</i>, some seven years\\r\\nearlier. Many women, not unnaturally, encouraged by the great examples\\r\\nof Miss Burney, Miss Edgeworth, Miss Austen, and Miss Ferrier, attempted\\r\\nnovels of the most various kinds, sometimes almost achieving the purely\\r\\ndomestic variety, sometimes branching to other sorts. The novels of Mrs.\\r\\nGore, chiefly in the &quot;fashionable&quot; kind, are said to have attained the\\r\\nthree-score and ten in number; Mrs. Crowe dealt with the supernatural\\r\\noutside of her novels if not also in them; the luckless poetess &quot;L.E.L.&quot;\\r\\nwas a novelist in <i>Ethel Churchill</i> (1837) and other books; Mrs.\\r\\nTrollope, prolific mother of a more prolific son, showed not a little\\r\\npower, if not quite so much taste, in <i>The Vicar of Wrexhill</i> (1837) and\\r\\n<i>The Widow Barnaby</i>. Single books, <a name=\"Page_225\" id=\"Page_225\" />like Morier\\'s <i>Hajji Baba</i> (1824),\\r\\nHope\\'s <i>Anastasius</i> (1819), Croly\\'s <i>Salathiel</i> (1829), gained fame\\r\\nwhich they have not quite lost: and the little known Michael Scott\\r\\n(1789-1835) left in <i>Tom Cringle\\'s Log</i> and <i>The Cruise of the Midge</i> a\\r\\npair of stories of West Indian scenery and adventure which are nearly\\r\\nfirst rate. In 1839, not long after <i>Pickwick</i>, Samuel Warren\\'s <i>Ten\\r\\nThousand a Year</i> blended Bulwer and Dickens in a manner which to this\\r\\nday is a puzzle in its near approach to success. Yet he never repeated\\r\\nthis approach, though he had earlier done striking things in the <i>Diary\\r\\nof a Late Physician</i> (1830). But in the latest thirties and early\\r\\nforties there arose two writers who were to eclipse every one of their\\r\\ncontemporaries in this kind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The remarkable originality and idiosyncrasy of Dickens have perhaps, to\\r\\nsome extent and from not a few persons, concealed the fact that he was\\r\\nnot, any more than other people, an earth-born wonder. Scanted of\\r\\neducation as he was, he has in several places frankly and eagerly\\r\\nconfessed his early acquaintance with the great older novelists, and his\\r\\nspecial fancy for Smollett&mdash;whose influence indeed is traceable on him\\r\\nfrom first to last, and not least in the famous &quot;interiors&quot; of which he\\r\\nmade far more than his example had done. Even in <i>Pickwick</i> the expert\\r\\nwill trace suggestions from others. But if the work is read in its\\r\\nproper order, and the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> are taken first, nobody who\\r\\nknows both Leigh Hunt and Theodore Hook will fail to see that Dickens\\r\\nowed a great deal to both. The fact is in no sense discreditable to him:\\r\\non the contrary, it adds, in the estimation of all reasonable and\\r\\ncritical judges, a very great deal of interest, and takes away none. The\\r\\nearth-born prodigy is seldom good for much and never for very much. The\\r\\ngenius who fastens on the points in preceding literature most congenial\\r\\nto him, develops them, <a name=\"Page_226\" id=\"Page_226\" />builds on them with his own matter and form, and\\r\\nturns out something far greater than his originals is the really\\r\\nsatisfactory person. Had Leigh Hunt lent to Hook his literature, his\\r\\nfund of trivial but agreeable observation and illustration, and his\\r\\nattractive style; had Hook communicated to Hunt his narrative faculty\\r\\nand his fecundity in character and manners:&mdash;neither could have written\\r\\n<i>Pickwick</i> or even the worst of its successors. Had there been no Hunt\\r\\nand no Hook, Dickens would no doubt have managed, in some fashion, to\\r\\n&quot;do for himself.&quot; But it would have given him more trouble, he would\\r\\nhave done it more slowly, and he would hardly have earned that generous\\r\\nand admirable phrase of his greatest contemporary in fiction which will\\r\\nbe quoted shortly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Neither from Smollett, however, nor from Hook, nor from Hunt, nor from\\r\\nanybody else did Dickens take what makes him Dickens. His idiosyncrasy,\\r\\nalready mentioned, is so marked that everybody acknowledges its\\r\\npresence: but its exact character and nature are matter not so much of\\r\\ndebate (though they are that also in the highest degree) as matter of\\r\\nmore or less <i>questing</i>, often of a rather blind-man\\'s-buff kind. There\\r\\nis probably no author of whom really critical estimates are so rare. He\\r\\nhas given so much pleasure to so many people&mdash;perhaps there are none to\\r\\nwhom he has given more pleasure than to some of those who have\\r\\ncriticised him most closely&mdash;that to mention any faults in him is\\r\\nupbraided as a sort of personal and detestable ingratitude and\\r\\ntreachery. If you say that he cannot draw a gentleman, you are told that\\r\\nyou are a parrot and a snob, who repeats what other snobs have told you;\\r\\nthat gentlemen are not worth drawing; that he <i>can</i> draw them; and so\\r\\nforth. If you suggest that he is fantastic, it is reproachfully asked if\\r\\npoetry is not fantastic, <a name=\"Page_227\" id=\"Page_227\" />and if you do not like poetry? If you intimate\\r\\nsmall affection for Little Nell and Little Paul, you are a brute; if you\\r\\nhint that his social crusades were often quite irrational, and sometimes\\r\\nat least as mischievous as they were beneficial, you are a parasite of\\r\\naristocracy and a foe of &quot;the people.&quot; If you take exception to his\\r\\nrepetitions, his mannerisms, his tedious catch-processes of various\\r\\nkinds, you are a &quot;stop-watch critic&quot; and worthy of all the generous\\r\\nwrath of the exemplary and Reverend Mr. Yorick. And yet all these\\r\\nassertions, objections, descriptions, are arch-true: and they can be\\r\\nmade by persons who know Dickens and enjoy Dickens a thousand times\\r\\nbetter&mdash;who admire him in a manner a thousand times more really\\r\\ncomplimentary&mdash;than the folk who simply cry &quot;Great is Dickens&quot; and will\\r\\nlisten to nothing but their own sweet voices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The real, the great, the unique merit of Dickens is that he brought to\\r\\nthe service of the novel an imagination which, though it was never\\r\\npoetic, was plastic in almost the highest degree: and that he\\r\\ncommunicated to the results of it a kind of existence which, though\\r\\ndistinctly different from that of actual life, has a reality of its own,\\r\\nand possesses the distinguishing mark of genius, so that if it does not\\r\\nexactly force belief in itself, it forces suspension of disbelief. To\\r\\nhave done this is not only to have accomplished a wonderful artistic\\r\\ntriumph, but to confer an immense benefit on the human race. But in\\r\\ndoing it Dickens exhibits various foibles, prejudices, and disabilities:\\r\\nthough it is quite open to any one to maintain that these rather\\r\\nassisted the flow of his imagination than hindered it. He began very\\r\\nyoung; he had curiously little literature; his knowledge of life,\\r\\nextraordinarily alert and acute, was very one-sided, and the organs by\\r\\nwhich he <a name=\"Page_228\" id=\"Page_228\" />attained it seem absolutely to shut themselves and refuse\\r\\ncommunion with certain orders of society and classes of human creatures.\\r\\nThe wealth of fantastic imagery which he used to such purpose not\\r\\ninfrequently stimulated him to a disorderly profusion of grotesque; he\\r\\nwas congenitally melodramatic; and before very long his habit of\\r\\nattributing special catch-words, gestures, and the like to his\\r\\ncharacters, exaggerated, degenerated, and stereotyped itself in a\\r\\nfashion which it is difficult to think satisfactory to anybody. He was,\\r\\nmoreover, a &quot;novelist of purpose&quot; in the highest degree; he had very\\r\\nstrong, but very crude&mdash;not to say absurd&mdash;political ideas; and he was\\r\\napt to let the great powers of pathos, of humour, of vivid description,\\r\\nwhich he possessed to &quot;get out of hand&quot; and to land him in the maudlin,\\r\\nthe extravagant, and the bombastic.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But&mdash;to put ourselves in connection with the main thread of our story\\r\\nonce more&mdash;he not only himself provided a great amount of the novel\\r\\npleasure for his readers, but he infused into the novel generally\\r\\nsomething of a new spirit. It has been more than once pointed out that\\r\\nthere is almost more danger with the novel of &quot;getting into ruts&quot; than\\r\\nwith any kind of literature. Nobody could charge the Dickens novel with\\r\\ndoing this, except as regards mannerisms of style, and though it might\\r\\ninspire many, it was very unlikely to create a rut for any one else. He\\r\\nliked to call himself &quot;the inimitable,&quot; and so, in a way, he was.\\r\\nImitations of him were, of course, tried: but they were all bad and\\r\\nobvious failures. Against the possible tameness of the domestic novel;\\r\\nagainst the too commonly actual want of actuality of the historic\\r\\nromance; he set this new fantastic activity of his, which was at once\\r\\nreal and unreal, but where the reality had a magical touch of the\\r\\nunfamiliar and the very unreality was stimulating. He <a name=\"Page_229\" id=\"Page_229\" />might have a\\r\\nhundred faults&mdash;he was in fact never faultless, except in <i>Pickwick</i>,\\r\\nwhich is so absolutely unique that there is nothing to compare with it\\r\\nand show up faults (if it has any) by the comparison. But you can read\\r\\nhim again and again with unceasing delight, and with delight of a kind\\r\\ngiven by no other novelist.<a id=\"footnotetag21\" name=\"footnotetag21\"></a><a href=\"#footnote21\"><sup>21</sup></a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The position of Thackeray in the history of the novel is as different\\r\\nfrom that of Dickens as the fortunes of the two were in their own\\r\\nprogress and development. In fact, though a sort of pseudo-Plutarchian\\r\\nparallel between them is nearly as inevitable as it is common, it is a\\r\\nparallel almost entirely composed of differences, carried out in matter\\r\\nalmost incommensurable. In the first place, Dickens, as we have seen,\\r\\nand as Thackeray said (with the generous and characteristic addition &quot;at\\r\\nthe head of the whole tribe&quot;), &quot;came and took his place calmly&quot; and\\r\\npractically at once (or with the preliminary only of &quot;Boz&quot;) in\\r\\n<i>Pickwick</i>. Whether he ever went further may at least be questioned. But\\r\\nThackeray did not take his place at once&mdash;in fact he conspicuously\\r\\nfailed to take it for some sixteen years: although he produced, for at\\r\\nleast the last ten of these, work containing indications of\\r\\nextraordinary power, in a variety of directions almost as extraordinary.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To attempt to assign reasons for this comparative failure would be\\r\\nidle&mdash;the fact is the only reasonable reason. But some phenomena and\\r\\nsymptoms can be diagnosed. It is at least noteworthy that Thackeray&mdash;in\\r\\nthis approaching Dickens perhaps nearer than in any other point&mdash;began\\r\\nwith extravaganza&mdash;to adopt perhaps the most con<a name=\"Page_230\" id=\"Page_230\" />venient general name\\r\\nfor a thing which cannot be quite satisfactorily designated by any. In\\r\\nboth cases the adoption was probably due to the example and popularity\\r\\nof Theodore Hook. But it was also due, in a higher and more metaphysical\\r\\nsense, to the fact that the romance, which had had so mighty a success\\r\\nin Scott\\'s hands, was for the time overblown, and that the domestic\\r\\nnovel, despite the almost equally wonderful, though much quieter and\\r\\nless popular achievement of Miss Austen, was not thoroughly and\\r\\ngenuinely ready. From extravaganza in a certain sense Dickens, as has\\r\\nbeen said, never really departed: and he achieved most of his best work\\r\\nin his own peculiar varieties of it. Thackeray was, if not to leave it\\r\\nentirely aside, to use it in his later days merely as an occasional\\r\\nvariation and seasoning. But at first he could not, apparently, get free\\r\\nfrom it: and he might have seemed unable to dispense with its almost\\r\\nmechanical externalities of mis-spelling and the like. It must also be\\r\\nremembered that circumstances were at first curiously unfavourable to\\r\\nhim: and that loss of fortune, domestic affliction, and other things\\r\\nalmost compelled him to write from hand to mouth&mdash;to take whatever\\r\\ncommission offered itself: whereas the, if not immediate, speedy and\\r\\ntremendous success of <i>Pickwick</i> put the booksellers entirely at\\r\\nDickens\\'s feet. Still, a certain vacillation&mdash;an uncertainty of design\\r\\nnot often accompanying genius like his&mdash;must be acknowledged in\\r\\nThackeray. For a time he hesitated between pen and pencil, the latter of\\r\\nwhich implements he fortunately never abandoned, though the former was\\r\\nhis predestined wand. Then he could not, or would not, for years, get\\r\\nout of the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; style, or patchwork of styles&mdash;reviews, short\\r\\nstories, burlesques, what not. His more important attempts seemed to\\r\\nhave an attendant<a name=\"Page_231\" id=\"Page_231\" /> <i>guignon</i>.<a id=\"footnotetag22\" name=\"footnotetag22\"></a><a href=\"#footnote22\"><sup>22</sup></a> <i>Catherine</i> (1839-1840), a very powerful\\r\\nthing in parts, was ill-planned and could not be popular. <i>A Shabby\\r\\nGenteel Story</i> (1841), containing almost the Thackerayan <i>quiddity</i>, was\\r\\ninterrupted partly by his wife\\'s illness, partly, it would seem, by\\r\\neditorial disfavour, and moreover still failed to shake off the\\r\\nappearance of a want of seriousness. Even <i>The Great Hoggarty Diamond</i>\\r\\n(1841-1842) was apparently cut short by request, and still lay open to\\r\\nan unjust, but not quite inexcusable, question on this same point of\\r\\n&quot;seriousness.&quot; In all there was, or might seem to be, a queer and to\\r\\nsome readers an unsatisfactory blend of what they had not learnt to call\\r\\n&quot;realism&quot; with what they were quite likely to think fooling. During\\r\\nthese years Thackeray was emphatically of the class of writers of whom\\r\\npeople &quot;do not know what to make.&quot; And it is a true saying of English\\r\\npeople&mdash;though perhaps not so pre-eminently true of them as some would\\r\\nhave it&mdash;that &quot;not to know what to make&quot; of a thing or a person is\\r\\nsufficient reason for them to distrust, dislike, and &quot;wash their hands\\r\\nof&quot; it or him.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some would have it that <i>Barry Lyndon</i> (1843) marks the close of this\\r\\nperiod of indecision and the beginning of that of maturity. The commoner\\r\\nand perhaps the juster opinion is that this position belongs to <i>Vanity\\r\\nFair</i> (1846-1848). At any rate, <i>after</i> that book there could be no\\r\\ndoubt about the fact of the greatness of its writer, though it may be\\r\\ndoubted whether even now the quality of this greatness is correctly and\\r\\ngenerally recognised. It is this&mdash;that at last the novel of real life on\\r\\nthe great scale has been discovered. Even yet a remnant of shyness hangs\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_232\" id=\"Page_232\" />on the artist. He puts his scene a little though not very far back; he\\r\\nborrows a little, though not much, historical and romantic interest in\\r\\nthe Waterloo part; the catastrophe of the Becky-Steyne business, though\\r\\nby no means outside of the probable contents of any day\\'s newspaper, is\\r\\nslightly exceptional. But on the whole the problem of &quot;reality, the\\r\\nwhole reality, and nothing but reality&quot; is faced and grasped and\\r\\nsolved&mdash;with, of course, the addition to the &quot;nothing but&quot; of &quot;except\\r\\nart.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>He had struck his path and he kept to it: even when, as in <i>Esmond</i>\\r\\n(1852) and <i>The Virginians</i> (1858-1859) actually, and in <i>Denis Duval</i>\\r\\nprospectively, he blended the historical with the domestic variety.\\r\\n<i>Pendennis</i> (1849-1850) imports nothing out of the most ordinary\\r\\nexperience; <i>The Newcomes</i> (1854-1855) very little; <i>Philip</i> (1861-1862)\\r\\nonly its pantomime conclusion; while the two completely historical tales\\r\\nare in nothing more remarkable than in the way in which their remoter\\r\\nand more unfamiliar main subject, and their occasional excursions from\\r\\neveryday life, are subdued to the scheme of the realist novel in the\\r\\nbest sense of the term&mdash;the novel rebuilt and refashioned on the lines\\r\\nof Fielding, but with modern manners, relying on variety and life, and\\r\\nrelying on these only.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is thus something of similarity (though with attendant\\r\\ndifferences, of the most important kind) between the joint position of\\r\\nDickens and Thackeray towards the world of the novel, and the joint\\r\\nposition of Scott and Miss Austen. They <i>overlap</i> more than their great\\r\\nforerunners of the preceding generation. Both wrote historical novels:\\r\\nit is indeed Thackeray\\'s unique distinction that he was equally master\\r\\nof the historical novel and of the novel of pure modern society, almost\\r\\nuneventful. In parts of some of his later books, especially <i>Little\\r\\nDorrit</i>,<a name=\"Page_233\" id=\"Page_233\" /> <i>Great Expectations</i>, and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, Dickens at\\r\\nleast tried to exchange his picaresque-fantastic cloudland for actual\\r\\nordinary modern life. But on the whole the method of Thackeray was the\\r\\nmethod of the novel, though shot with a strong romantic spirit, and the\\r\\nmethod of Dickens the method of the romance applied, for the most part,\\r\\nto material which could hardly be called romantic. Both, therefore, in a\\r\\nmanner, recalled the forces of fiction from the rather straggling and\\r\\nparticularist courses which it had been pursuing for the last quarter of\\r\\na century.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In fact, even in the two mighty men of genius whom we have just been\\r\\ndiscussing, there may be seen&mdash;at their beginnings at least&mdash;something\\r\\nof that irresolution, uncertainty, and want of reliance on the powers of\\r\\nthe novel, it-by-itself-it, which we have noticed before: and which the\\r\\nunerring craftsmanship of Scott had already pointed out in the\\r\\n&quot;Conversation of the Author of <i>Waverley</i> with Captain Clutterbuck&quot; more\\r\\nthan once referred to. They want excuses and pretexts, bladders and\\r\\nspring-boards. Even Dickens, despite his irrepressible self-reliance,\\r\\nburdens himself, at the beginning of <i>Pickwick</i>, with the clumsy old\\r\\nmachinery of a club which he practically drops: and, still later, with\\r\\nthe still more clumsy framework of &quot;Master Humphrey\\'s Clock&quot; which he\\r\\nhas not quietly to drop, but openly to strip off and cast away, before\\r\\nhe has gone very far. Thackeray takes sixteen years of experiment before\\r\\nhe trusts his genius, boldly and on the great scale, to reveal itself in\\r\\nits own way, and in the straight way of the novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet in this time also a great advance was made, as is shown not only by\\r\\nthe fact that Dickens and Thackeray themselves became possible, but by\\r\\nthe various achievements of the principal writers mentioned in this\\r\\nchapter, <a name=\"Page_234\" id=\"Page_234\" />of one or two who might have been, but are perhaps, on the\\r\\nwhole, best postponed to the next, such as Lever, and of the great army\\r\\nof minorities who have been of necessity omitted. In every direction and\\r\\nfrom every point of view novel is <i>growing</i>. Although it was abused by\\r\\nprecisians, the <i>gran conquesta</i> of Scott had forced it into general\\r\\nrecognition and requisition. Even the still severe discipline of family\\r\\nlife in the first half of the nineteenth century, instead of excluding\\r\\nit altogether, contented itself with prescribing that &quot;novels should not\\r\\nbe read in the morning.&quot; A test which may be thought vulgar by the\\r\\nsuper-fine or the superficial, but a pretty good one, is the altered\\r\\nstatus and position of the writers of novels. In the eighteenth,\\r\\nespecially the earlier eighteenth, century the novelist had not merely\\r\\nbeen looked down upon <i>as</i> a novelist, but had, as a rule, resorted to\\r\\nnovel-writing under some stress of circumstance. Even when he was by\\r\\nbirth a &quot;gentleman of coat armour&quot; as Fielding and Smollett were, he was\\r\\nusually a gentleman very much out at elbows: the stories, true or false,\\r\\nof <i>Rasselas</i> and Johnson\\'s mother\\'s funeral expenses, of the <i>Vicar of\\r\\nWakefield</i> and Goldsmith\\'s dunning landlady, have something more than\\r\\nmere anecdote in them. Mackenzie, though the paternity of his <i>famille\\r\\nd&eacute;plorable</i> of novels was no secret, preserved a strict nominal\\r\\nincognito. Women, as having no regular professions and plenty of time at\\r\\ntheir disposal, were allowed more latitude: and this really perhaps had\\r\\nsomething to do with their early prominence in the novel; but it is\\r\\ncertain that Scott\\'s rigid, and for a long time successful, maintenance\\r\\nof the mask was by no means mere prudery, and still less merely prudent\\r\\ncommercial speculation. Yet he, who altered so much in the novel,\\r\\naltered this also. Of the novelists noticed in the early part <a name=\"Page_235\" id=\"Page_235\" />of this\\r\\nchapter, one became Prime Minister of England, another rose to cabinet\\r\\nrank, a baronetcy, and a peerage; a third was H.M. consul in important\\r\\nposts abroad; a fourth held a great position, if not in the service\\r\\ndirectly of the crown, in what was of hardly less importance, that of\\r\\nthe East India Company; a fifth was a post-captain in the navy and\\r\\nCompanion of the Bath.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And all this had been rendered possible partly by the genius of\\r\\nnovel-writers, partly by the appetite of the novel-reader. This latter\\r\\nwas to continue unabated: whether the former was to increase, to\\r\\nmaintain itself, or slacken must be, to some extent of course, matter of\\r\\nopinion. But we have still two quarter-centuries to survey, in the first\\r\\nof which there may perhaps be some reason for thinking that the novel\\r\\nrose to its actual zenith. Nearly all the writers mentioned in this\\r\\nchapter continued to write&mdash;the greater part, in genius, of Thackeray\\'s\\r\\naccomplished work, and the greater part, in bulk, of Dickens\\'s, had\\r\\nstill to appear. But these elders were reinforced by fresh recruits,\\r\\nsome of them of a prowess only inferior to the very greatest: and a\\r\\ndistinct development of the novel itself, in the direction of\\r\\nself-reliance and craftsmanlike working on its own lines, was to be\\r\\nseen. In particular, the deferred influence of Miss Austen was at last\\r\\nto be brought to bear with astonishing results: while, partly owing to\\r\\nthe example of Thackeray, the historical variety (which had for the most\\r\\npart been a pale and rather vulgarised imitation of Scott), was to be\\r\\nrevived and varied in a manner equally astonishing. More than ever we\\r\\nshall have to let styles and kinds &quot;speak by their foremen&quot;&mdash;in fact to\\r\\nsome extent to let them speak for themselves with very little detailed\\r\\nnotice even of these foremen. But we shall still endeavour to keep the\\r\\ngeneral threads <a name=\"Page_236\" id=\"Page_236\" />in hand and to exhibit their direction, their crossing,\\r\\nand their other phenomena, as clearly as possible to the reader. For\\r\\nonly so can we complete the picture of the course of fiction throughout\\r\\nEnglish literature&mdash;with the sole exclusion of living writers, whose\\r\\nwork can never be satisfactorily treated in such a book as this&mdash;first,\\r\\nbecause they are living and, secondly, because it is not done.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_VII\" id=\"CHAPTER_VII\" /><a name=\"Page_237\" id=\"Page_237\" />CHAPTER VII</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>THE MID-VICTORIAN NOVEL</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At about the very middle of the nineteenth century&mdash;say from 1845 to\\r\\n1855 in each direction, but almost increasingly towards the actual\\r\\ndividing line of 1850&mdash;there came upon the English novel a very\\r\\nremarkable wind of refreshment and new endeavour. Thackeray and Dickens\\r\\nthemselves are examples of it, with Lever and others, before this\\r\\ndividing line: many others yet come to join them. A list of books\\r\\nwritten out just as they occur to the memory, and without any attempt to\\r\\nmarshal them in strict chronological order, would show this beyond all\\r\\nreasonable possibility of gainsaying. Thackeray\\'s own best accomplished\\r\\nwork from <i>Vanity Fair</i> (1846) itself through <i>Pendennis</i> (1849) and\\r\\n<i>Esmond</i> (1852) to <i>The Newcomes</i> (1854); the brilliant centre of\\r\\nDickens\\'s work in <i>David Copperfield</i> (1850)&mdash;stand at the head and have\\r\\nbeen already noticed by anticipation or implication, while Lever had\\r\\nalmost completed the first division of his work, which began with <i>Harry\\r\\nLorrequer</i> as early as the year of <i>Pickwick</i>. But such books as <i>Yeast</i>\\r\\n(1848), <i>Westward Ho!</i> (1855); as <i>The Warden</i> (1855); as <i>Jane Eyre</i>\\r\\n(1847) and its too few successors; as <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i> (1857);\\r\\nas <i>Mary Barton</i> (1848) and the novels which followed it, with others\\r\\nwhich it is perhaps almost unfair to leave out even in this allusive\\r\\nsummary by sample, betokened a stirring of the waters, a rattling among\\r\\nthe bones, such as is not common in literature. Death removed Thackeray\\r\\nearly and Dickens somewhat less prematurely, <a name=\"Page_238\" id=\"Page_238\" />but after a period rather\\r\\nbarren in direct novel work. The others continued and were constantly\\r\\nreinforced: nor was it till well on in the seventies that any distinct\\r\\ndrop from first- to second-growth quality could be observed in the\\r\\ngeneral vintage of English fiction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One is not quite driven, on this occasion, to the pusillanimous\\r\\nexplanation that this remarkable variety and number of good novels was\\r\\nsimply due to the simultaneous existence of an equally remarkable number\\r\\nof good novelists. The fact is that, by this time, the great example of\\r\\nScott and Miss Austen&mdash;the great wave of progress which exemplified\\r\\nitself first and most eminently in these two writers&mdash;had had time to\\r\\nwork upon and permeate another generation of practitioners. The\\r\\nnovelists who have just been cited were as a rule born in the second\\r\\ndecade of the century, just before, about, or after the time at which\\r\\nScott and Miss Austen began to publish. They had therefore&mdash;as their\\r\\nelders, even though they may have had time to read the pair, had\\r\\nnot&mdash;time to assimilate thoroughly and early the results which that pair\\r\\nhad produced or which they had first expressed. And they had even\\r\\ngreater advantages than this. They had had time to assimilate, likewise,\\r\\nthe results of all the rest of that great literary generation of which\\r\\nScott and Miss Austen were themselves but members. They profited by\\r\\nthirty years more of constant historical exploration and realising of\\r\\nformer days. One need not say, for it is question-begging, that they\\r\\nalso <i>profited</i> by, but they could at least avail themselves of, the\\r\\nimmense change of manners and society which made 1850 differ more from\\r\\n1800 than 1800 had differed, not merely from 1750 but from 1700. They\\r\\nhad, even though all of them may not have been sufficiently grateful for\\r\\nit, the stimulus of that premier position in Europe <a name=\"Page_239\" id=\"Page_239\" />which the country\\r\\nhad gained in the Napoleonic wars, and which she had not yet wholly lost\\r\\nor even begun to lose. They had wider travel, more extended occupations\\r\\nand interests, many other new things to draw upon. And, lastly, they had\\r\\nsome important special incidents and movements&mdash;the new arrangement of\\r\\npolitical parties, the Oxford awakening, and others&mdash;to give suggestion\\r\\nand impetus to novels of the specialist kind. Nay, they had not only the\\r\\ngreat writers, in other kinds, of the immediate past, but those of the\\r\\npresent, Carlyle, Tennyson, latterly Ruskin, and others still to\\r\\ncomplete their education and the machinery of its development.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The most remarkable feature of this <i>renouveau</i>, as has been both\\r\\ndirectly and indirectly observed before, is the resumption, the immense\\r\\nextension, and the extraordinary improvement of the domestic novel. Not\\r\\nthat this had not been practised during the thirty years since Miss\\r\\nAusten\\'s death. But the external advantages just enumerated had failed\\r\\nit: and it had enlisted none of the chief talents which were at the\\r\\nservice of fiction generally. A little more gift and a good deal more\\r\\ntaste might have enabled Mrs. Trollope to do really great things in it:\\r\\nbut she left them for her son to accomplish. Attempts and &quot;tries&quot; at it\\r\\nhad been made constantly, and the goal had been very nearly reached,\\r\\nespecially, perhaps, in that now much forgotten but remarkable <i>Emilia\\r\\nWyndham</i> (1846) by Anne Caldwell (Mrs. Marsh), which was wickedly\\r\\ndescribed by a sister novelist as the &quot;book where the woman breaks her\\r\\ndesk open with her head,&quot; but which has real power and exercised real\\r\\ninfluence for no short time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This new domestic novel followed Miss Austen in that it did not\\r\\nnecessarily avail itself of anything but perfectly <a name=\"Page_240\" id=\"Page_240\" />ordinary life, and\\r\\nrelied chiefly on artistic presentment&mdash;on treatment rather than on\\r\\nsubject. It departed from her in that it admitted a much wider range and\\r\\nvariety of subject itself; and by no means excluded the passions and\\r\\nemotions which, though she had not been so prudish as to ignore their\\r\\nresults, she had never chosen to represent in much actual exercise, or\\r\\nto make the mainsprings of her books.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first supreme work of the kind was perhaps in <i>Vanity Fair</i> and\\r\\n<i>Pendennis</i>, the former admitting exceptional and irregular developments\\r\\nas an integral part of its plot and general appeal, the latter doing for\\r\\nthe most part without them. But <i>Pendennis</i> exhibited in itself, and\\r\\ntaught to other novelists, if not an absolutely new, a hitherto little\\r\\nworked, and clumsily worked, source of novel interest. We have seen how,\\r\\nas early as Head or Kirkman, the possibility of making such a source out\\r\\nof the ways of special trades, professions, employments, and vocations\\r\\nhad been partly seen and utilised. Defoe did it more; Smollett more\\r\\nstill; and since the great war there had been naval and military novels\\r\\nin abundance, as well as novels political, clerical, sporting, and what\\r\\nnot. But these special interests had been as a rule drawn upon too\\r\\nonesidedly. The eighteenth century found its mistaken fondness for\\r\\nepisodes, inset stories, and the like, particularly convenient here: the\\r\\nnaval, military, sporting, and other novels of the nineteenth were apt\\r\\nto rely too exclusively on these differences. Such things as the\\r\\nOxbridge scenes and the journalism scenes of <i>Pendennis</i>&mdash;both among the\\r\\nmost effective and popular, perhaps <i>the</i> most effective and popular,\\r\\nparts of the book&mdash;were almost, if not entirely, new. There had been\\r\\nbefore, and have since been, plenty of university novels, and their\\r\\nrecord has been a record of <a name=\"Page_241\" id=\"Page_241\" />almost uninterrupted failure; there have\\r\\nsince, if not before, <i>Pendennis</i> been several &quot;press&quot; novels, and their\\r\\nrecord has certainly not been a record of unbroken success. But the\\r\\nemployment here, by genius, of such subjects for substantial <i>parts</i> of\\r\\na novel was a success pure and unmixed. So, in the earlier book, the\\r\\nsame author had shown how the most humdrum incident and the minutest\\r\\npainting of ordinary character could be combined with historic tragedy\\r\\nlike that furnished by Waterloo, with domestic <i>drame</i> of the most\\r\\nexciting kind like the discovery of Lord Steyne\\'s relations with Becky,\\r\\nor the at least suggested later crime of that ingenious and rather\\r\\nhardly treated little person.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most of the writers mentioned and glanced at above took&mdash;not of course\\r\\nalways, often, or perhaps ever in conscious following of Thackeray, but\\r\\nin consequence of the same &quot;skiey influences&quot; which worked on him&mdash;to\\r\\nthis mixed domestic-dramatic line. And what is still more interesting,\\r\\nmen who had already made their mark for years, in styles quite\\r\\ndifferent, turned to it and adopted it. We have seen this of Bulwer, and\\r\\nthe evidences of the change in him which are given by the &quot;Caxton&quot;\\r\\nnovels. We have not yet directly dealt with another instance of almost\\r\\nas great interest and distinction, Charles Lever, though we have named\\r\\nhim and glanced at his work.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lever, who was born as early as 1806, had, it has been said, begun to\\r\\nwrite novels as early as his junior, Dickens, and had at once developed,\\r\\nin <i>Harry Lorrequer</i>, a pretty distinct style of his own. This style was\\r\\na kind of humour-novel with abundant incident, generally with a somewhat\\r\\n&quot;promiscuous&quot; plot and with lively but externally drawn characters&mdash;the\\r\\nhumours being furnished partly <a name=\"Page_242\" id=\"Page_242\" />by Lever\\'s native country, Ireland, and\\r\\npartly by the traditions of the great war of which he had collected a\\r\\nstore in his capacity of physician to the Embassy at Brussels. He had\\r\\nkept up this style, the capital example of which is <i>Charles O\\'Malley</i>\\r\\n(1840), with unabated <i>verve</i> and with great popular success for a dozen\\r\\nyears before 1850. But about that time, or rather earlier, the general\\r\\n&quot;suck&quot; of the current towards a different kind (assisted no doubt by the\\r\\nfeeling that the public might be getting tired of the other style) made\\r\\nhim change it into studies of a less specialised kind&mdash;of foreign\\r\\ntravel, home life, and the like&mdash;sketches which, in his later days\\r\\nstill, he brought even closer to actuality. It is true that in the long\\r\\nrun his popularity has depended, and will probably always depend, on the\\r\\nearly &quot;rollicking&quot; adventure books: not only because of their natural\\r\\nappeal, but because there is plenty of the other thing elsewhere, and\\r\\nhardly any of this particular thing anywhere. To almost anybody, for\\r\\ninstance, except a very great milksop or a pedant of construction,\\r\\n<i>Charles O\\'Malley</i> with its love-making and its fighting, its\\r\\nhorsemanship and its horse-play, its &quot;devilled kidneys&quot;<a id=\"footnotetag23\" name=\"footnotetag23\"></a><a href=\"#footnote23\"><sup>23</sup></a> and its\\r\\ndevil-may-care-ness, is a distinctly delectable composition; and if a\\r\\nreasonable interval be allowed between the readings, may be read over\\r\\nand over again, at all times of life, with satisfaction. But the fact of\\r\\nthe author\\'s change remains not the less historically and\\r\\nsymptomatically important, in connection with the larger change of which\\r\\nwe are now taking notice, and with the similar phenomena observable in\\r\\nthe work of Bulwer. At the same time it has been pointed out that the\\r\\nfollowing of Miss Austen by no means excluded the follow<a name=\"Page_243\" id=\"Page_243\" />ing of Scott:\\r\\nand that the new development included &quot;crosses&quot; of novel and romance,\\r\\nsometimes of the historical kind, sometimes not, which are of the\\r\\nhighest, or all but the highest, interest. Early and good examples of\\r\\nthese may be found in the work of the Bront&euml;s, Charlotte and Emily (the\\r\\nthird sister Anne is but a pale reflection of her elders), and of\\r\\nCharles Kingsley. Charlotte (b. 1816) and Charles (b. 1819) were\\r\\nseparated in their birth by but three years, Emily (b. 1818) and\\r\\nKingsley by but one.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The curious story of the struggles of the Bront&euml; girls to get published\\r\\nhardly concerns us, and Emily\\'s work, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,<a id=\"footnotetag24\" name=\"footnotetag24\"></a><a href=\"#footnote24\"><sup>24</sup></a> is one of\\r\\nthose isolated books which, whatever their merit, are rather ornaments\\r\\nthan essential parts in novel history. But this is not the case with\\r\\n<i>Jane Eyre</i> (1847), <i>Shirley</i> (1849), <i>Villette</i> (1852), and <i>The\\r\\nProfessor</i> (1857) (but written much earlier). These are all examples of\\r\\nthe determination to base novels on actual life and experience. Few\\r\\nnovelists have ever kept so close to their own part in these as\\r\\nCharlotte Bront&euml; did, though she accompanied, permeated, and to a\\r\\ncertain extent transformed her autobiography and observation by a\\r\\nstrong romantic and fantastic imaginative element. Deprive Thackeray and\\r\\nDickens of nearly all their humour and geniality, take a portion only of\\r\\nthe remaining genius of each in the ratio of about 2 <i>Th</i>. to 1 <i>D</i>.,\\r\\nadd a certain dash of the old terror-novel and the German fantastic\\r\\ntale, moisten with feminine spirit and water, and mix thoroughly: and\\r\\nyou have something very like Charlotte Bront&euml;. But it is necessary to\\r\\nadd further, and it is her great glory, the perfume and atmosphere of\\r\\nthe Yorkshire moors, which she had in not quite such perfection as her\\r\\nsister Emily, <a name=\"Page_244\" id=\"Page_244\" />but in combination with more general novel-gift. Her\\r\\nactual course of writing was short, and it could probably in no case\\r\\nhave been long; she wanted wider and, perhaps, happier experience, more\\r\\nliterature, more man-and-woman-of-the-worldliness, perhaps a sweeter and\\r\\nmore genial temper. But the English novel would have been incomplete\\r\\nwithout her and her sister; they are, as wholes, unlike anybody else,\\r\\nand if they are not exactly great they have the quality of greatness.\\r\\nAbove all, they kept novel and romance together&mdash;a deed which is great\\r\\nwithout any qualification or drawback.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Charles Kingsley is one of the most precious documents for the cynics\\r\\nwho say that while, if you please the public in only one way, you may\\r\\npossibly meet with only tolerable ingratitude; if you attempt to please\\r\\nit in more ways than one, you are certain to be suspected, and still\\r\\nmore certain to have the defects of your weakest work transferred to\\r\\nyour best. He was a novelist, a poet, an essayist, a preacher, a\\r\\nhistorian, and a critic. His history, though less positively inaccurate\\r\\nthan the &quot;dead set&quot; against him of certain notorious persons chose to\\r\\nrepresent it, was uncritical: and his criticism, sometimes acute and\\r\\nluminous, was decidedly unhistorical. But he was a preacher of\\r\\nremarkable merit, a charming and original essayist, a poet of no wide\\r\\nrange but of true poetical quality, and a novelist of great variety and\\r\\nof almost the first class. He let his weakest qualities go in with his\\r\\nstrongest in his novels, and had also the still more unfortunate\\r\\ntendency to &quot;trail coats&quot; of the most inconceivably different colours\\r\\nfor others to tread upon. Liberals, Radicals, and Tories; Roman\\r\\nCatholics, High Churchmen, Low Churchmen, and No-Churchmen;\\r\\nsentimentalists and cynics; people who do not like literary and\\r\\nhistorical allusion, and people who <a name=\"Page_245\" id=\"Page_245\" />are meticulous about literary and\\r\\nhistorical accuracy&mdash;all these and many others, if they cannot disregard\\r\\nflings at their own particular tastes, fancies, and notions, are sure to\\r\\nlose patience with him now and then. Accordingly, he has met with some\\r\\nexacerbated decriers, and with very few thorough-going defenders.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet <i>almost</i> thoroughing-going defence is, as far as the novels (our\\r\\nonly direct business) are concerned, far from difficult; and the present\\r\\nwriter, though there are perhaps not a dozen consecutive pages of\\r\\nKingsley\\'s novels to which, at some point or other, he is not prepared\\r\\nto append the note, &quot;This is Bosh,&quot; is prepared also to exalt him miles\\r\\nabove writers whose margins he would be quite content to leave without a\\r\\nsingle annotation of this&mdash;or any other&mdash;kind. In particular the variety\\r\\nof the books, and their vividness, are both extraordinary. And perhaps\\r\\nthe greatest notes of the novel generally, as well as those in which the\\r\\nnovel of this period can most successfully challenge comparison with\\r\\nthose of any other, are, or should be, vividness and variety. His books\\r\\nin the kind are seven; and the absence of <i>replicas</i> among them is one\\r\\nof their extraordinary features. <i>Yeast</i>, the first (1848), and <i>Alton\\r\\nLocke</i>, the second (next year), are novels of the unrest of thought\\r\\nwhich caused and accompanied the revolutionary movement of the period\\r\\nthroughout Europe. But they are quite different in subject and\\r\\ntreatment. The first is a sketch of country society, uppermost and\\r\\nlowermost:<a id=\"footnotetag25\" name=\"footnotetag25\"></a><a href=\"#footnote25\"><sup>25</sup></a> the second one of town-artisan and lower-trade life with\\r\\npassages of university and other contrast. Both are young and crude\\r\\nenough, intentionally or unintentionally; <a name=\"Page_246\" id=\"Page_246\" />both, intentionally beyond\\r\\nall doubt, are fantastic and extravagant; but both are full of genius.\\r\\nArgemone Lavington, the heroine of <i>Yeast</i>, is, though not of the most\\r\\nelaborately drawn, one of the most fascinating and real heroines of\\r\\nEnglish fiction; an important secondary character of the second book,\\r\\nthe bookseller Sandy Mackaye, is one of its most successful\\r\\n&quot;character-parts.&quot; Both, but especially <i>Yeast</i>, are full of admirable\\r\\ndescriptive writing, not entirely without indebtedness to Mr. Ruskin,\\r\\nbut very often independently carried out, and always worthy of a &quot;place\\r\\non the line&quot; in any gallery. There is much accurate and real dialogue,\\r\\nnot a little firm character-drawing. Above all, both are full of\\r\\nblood&mdash;of things lived and seen, not vamped up from reading or\\r\\nday-dreaming&mdash;and yet full of dreams, day and other, and full of\\r\\nliterature. Perhaps &quot;the malt was a little above the meal,&quot; the yeast\\r\\npresent in more abundant quality than the substances for fermentation,\\r\\nbut there was no lack even of these.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Hypatia</i>&mdash;which succeeded after some interval (1853) and when the\\r\\nwriter\\'s Christian Socialist, Churchman-Chartist excitement had somewhat\\r\\nclarified itself&mdash;is a more substantial, a more ambitious, but certainly\\r\\nalso an even more successful book. It has something of&mdash;and perhaps,\\r\\nthough in far transposed matter, owes something to&mdash;<i>Esmond</i> in its\\r\\ndaring blend of old and new, and it falls short of that wonderful\\r\\ncreation. But it is almost a second to it: and, with plenty of faults,\\r\\nis perhaps the only classical or semi-classical novel of much value in\\r\\nEnglish.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But it was in the next year, 1854, that Kingsley\\'s work reached its\\r\\ngreatest perfection in the brilliant historical novel of <i>Westward Ho!</i>\\r\\nwhere the glories of Elizabethan adventure and patriotism were treated\\r\\nwith a wonderful kindred enthusiasm, with admirable narrative faculty,\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_247\" id=\"Page_247\" />with a creation of character, suitable for the purpose, which is hardly\\r\\ninferior to that of the greatest masters, and with an even enhanced and\\r\\ncertainly chastened exercise of the descriptive faculty above noticed.\\r\\nThe book to some extent invited&mdash;and Kingsley availed himself of the\\r\\nopportunity in a far more than sufficient degree&mdash;that &quot;coat-trailing&quot;\\r\\nwhich, as has been said, inevitably in its turn provokes &quot;coat-treading&quot;:\\r\\nand it has been abused from various quarters. But that it is one of\\r\\nthe very greatest of English novels next to the few supreme, impartial\\r\\nand competent criticism will never hesitate to allow. Of his remaining\\r\\nbooks of novel kind one was of the &quot;eccentric&quot; variety: the others,\\r\\nthough full of good things, were perhaps on the whole failures. The\\r\\nfirst referred to (the second in order of appearance), <i>The Water\\r\\nBabies</i> (1863), is a half Rabelaisian though perfectly inoffensive\\r\\n<i>fatrasie</i> of all sorts of things, exceedingly delightful to fit tastes.\\r\\nBut <i>Two Tears Ago</i> (1857), though containing some fine and even really\\r\\nexquisite things, shows a relaxing hand on the crudity and\\r\\npromiscuousness which had been excusable in his two first books and had\\r\\nbeen well restrained in <i>Hypatia</i> and <i>Westward Ho!</i> by central and\\r\\nactive interests of story and character. &quot;Spasmodic&quot; poetry, the Crimean\\r\\nWar, Pre-Raphaelitism, Tractarianism, the good and bad sides of science,\\r\\nand divers other things make a mixture that is not sufficiently\\r\\nconcocted and &quot;rectified.&quot; While in the much later <i>Hereward the Wake</i>\\r\\n(1866), though the provocation offered to the Dryasdust kind of\\r\\nhistorian is no matter, there is a curious relapse on the old fault of\\r\\nincorporating too much history or pseudo-history, and the same failure\\r\\nas in <i>Two Tears Ago</i>, or perhaps a greater one in degree, to concoct\\r\\nthe story (which is little more than a chronicle) together with a\\r\\ncertain neglect <a name=\"Page_248\" id=\"Page_248\" />to conciliate the sympathies of the reader. But the\\r\\nwhole batch is a memorable collection; and it shows, rather\\r\\nexceptionally, the singular originality and variety of the novel at this\\r\\ntime.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This remarkable pair may be supplemented by an in some ways more\\r\\nremarkable trio, all of them pretty close contemporaries, but, for\\r\\ndifferent reasons in each case, coming rather late into the novel\\r\\nfield&mdash;Charles Reade (b. 1814), Anthony Trollope (b. 1815), and Mary Ann\\r\\nEvans (b. 1819). It would be difficult to find three persons more\\r\\ndifferent in temperament; impossible to find more striking instances of\\r\\nthe way in which the new blend of romance and novel lent itself to the\\r\\nmost various uses and developments. Reade&mdash;who thought himself a\\r\\ndramatist and wasted upon drama a great deal of energy and an almost\\r\\nideal position as a possessor of an unusually rich fellowship at\\r\\nMagdalen College, Oxford, with no duties&mdash;came rather closer to Dickens\\r\\nthan to any novelist previously named, not merely in a sort of\\r\\nnon-poetic but powerful imagination, but also in the mania for attacking\\r\\nwhat seemed to him abuses&mdash;in lunatic asylums (on which point he was\\r\\nvery nearly a monomaniac himself), prisons, and many other things. But\\r\\nhe is almost more noteworthy, from our point of view, because of his\\r\\nuse&mdash;it also must, one fears, be called an abuse&mdash;of a process obviously\\r\\ninvited by the new demand for truth to life, and profitable up to a\\r\\ncertain point. This was the collection, in enormous scrapbooks, of\\r\\nnewspaper cuttings on a vast variety of subjects, to be worked up into\\r\\nfiction when the opportunity served. Reade had so much genius&mdash;he had\\r\\nperhaps the most, in a curious rather incalculable fashion, of the whole\\r\\ngroup&mdash;that he very nearly succeeded in digesting these &quot;marine stores&quot;\\r\\nof detail and document into real books. But he did not <a name=\"Page_249\" id=\"Page_249\" />always, and\\r\\ncould not always, quite do it: and he remains, with Zola, the chief\\r\\nexample of the danger of working at your subject too much as if you were\\r\\ngetting up a brief, or preparing an article for an encyclopedia. Still,\\r\\nhis greatest books, which are probably <i>It is Never too Late to Mend</i>\\r\\n(1856) and <i>The Cloister and the Hearth</i> (1861), have immense vigour\\r\\nand, in the second case, an almost poetic attraction which Dickens never\\r\\nreaches, while over all sparks and veins of genius are scattered.\\r\\nMoreover, he is interesting because, until his own time, he would have\\r\\nbeen quite impossible; and, even at that time, without the general\\r\\nmovement which we are describing, very unlikely.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is not so much object here in discussing the much discussed\\r\\nquestion of the merits and defects of &quot;George Eliot&quot; (Mary Ann Evans or\\r\\nMrs. Cross) as a novelist, as there is in pointing out her relations to\\r\\nthis general movement. She began late, and almost accidentally; and\\r\\nthere is less unity in her general work than in some others here\\r\\nmentioned. Her earliest and perhaps, in adjusted and &quot;reduced&quot;\\r\\njudgments, her best work&mdash;<i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i> (1857-1858), <i>Adam\\r\\nBede</i> (1859), <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> (1860), <i>Silas Marner</i>\\r\\n(1861)&mdash;consists of very carefully observed and skilfully rendered\\r\\nstudies of country life and character, tinged, especially in <i>Adam Bede</i>\\r\\nand <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, with very intense and ambitious colours of\\r\\npassion. The great popularity of this tempted her into still more\\r\\nelaborate efforts of different kinds. Her attempt in quasi-historical\\r\\nromance, <i>Romola</i> (1865), was an enormous <i>tour de force</i> in which the\\r\\nwriter struggled to get historical and local colour, accurate and\\r\\nirreproachable, with all the desperation of the most conscientious\\r\\nrelater of actual history. <i>Felix Holt the Radical</i> (1866), <i>Middle\\r\\nMarch</i> (1872), and <i>Daniel Deronda</i> (1876) were equally elaborate\\r\\nsketches <a name=\"Page_250\" id=\"Page_250\" />of modern English society, planned and engineered with the\\r\\nsame provision of carefully laboured plot, character, and phrase.\\r\\nAlthough received with enthusiasm by the partisans whom she had created\\r\\nfor herself, these books have seemed to some <i>over</i>-laboured, and if not\\r\\nexactly unreal, yet to a certain extent unnatural. But the point for us\\r\\nis their example of the way in which the novel&mdash;once a light and almost\\r\\nfrivolous thing&mdash;had come to be taken with the utmost seriousness&mdash;had\\r\\nin fact ceased to be light literature at all, and begun to require\\r\\nrigorous and elaborate training and preparation in the writer, perhaps\\r\\neven something of the athlete\\'s processes in the reader. Its state may\\r\\nor may not have advanced in grace <i>pari passu</i> with the advance in\\r\\neffort and in dignity: but this later advance is at least there.\\r\\nFielding himself took novel-writing by no means lightly, and Richardson\\r\\nstill less so: but imagine either, imagine Scott or even Miss Austen,\\r\\ngoing through the preliminary processes which seemed necessary, in\\r\\ndifferent ways, to Charles Reade and to Mary Ann Evans!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a certain sense, however, the last of the three, though he may give\\r\\nless impression of genius than the other two (or even the other four\\r\\nwhom we have specially noticed), is the most interesting of all: and\\r\\nqualms may sometimes arise as to whether genius is justly denied to him.\\r\\nAnthony Trollope, after a youth, not exactly <i>orageuse</i>, but apparently\\r\\ncharacterised by the rather squalid yet mild dissipation which he has\\r\\ndescribed in <i>The Three Clerks</i> (1858) and <i>The Small House at\\r\\nAllington</i> (1864), attained a considerable position in the Post Office\\r\\nwhich he held during great part of his career as a novelist. For some\\r\\ntime that career did not look as if it were going to be a successful\\r\\none, though his early (chiefly Irish) efforts are better than is\\r\\nsometimes thought. But he made his mark first with<a name=\"Page_251\" id=\"Page_251\" /> <i>The Warden</i> (1855),\\r\\nand then, much more directly and triumphantly, with its sequel\\r\\n<i>Barchester Towers</i> (1857). When the first of these was published\\r\\nDickens had been a successful novelist for nearly twenty years and\\r\\nThackeray had &quot;come to his own&quot; for nearly ten. <i>The Warden</i> might have\\r\\nbeen described at the time (I do not know whether it was, but English\\r\\nreviewing was only beginning to be clever again) as a partial attempt at\\r\\nthe matter of Dickens in a partial following of the manner of Thackeray.\\r\\nAn &quot;abuse&quot;&mdash;the distribution in supposed unjust proportion of the funds\\r\\nof an endowed hospital for aged men&mdash;is its main avowed subject. But\\r\\nTrollope indulged in no tirades and no fantastic-grotesque\\r\\ncaricature&mdash;in fact he actually drew a humorous sketch of a novel <i>&agrave; la\\r\\nDickens</i> on the matter. His real object was evidently to sketch\\r\\nfaithfully, but again not without humour, the cathedral society of\\r\\n&quot;Barchester&quot; as it actually spoke, dressed, thought, and lived: and he\\r\\ndid it. The first book had a little too much talk about the nominal\\r\\nsubject, and not enough actual action and conversation. <i>Barchester\\r\\nTowers</i> remedied this, and presented its readers with one of the\\r\\nliveliest books in English fiction. There had been nothing like it (for\\r\\nThackeray had been more discursive and less given to small talk) since\\r\\nMiss Austen herself, though the spirits of the two were extremely\\r\\ndifferent. Perhaps Trollope never did a better book than this, for\\r\\nvariety and vigour of character drawing. The masterful wife of Bishop\\r\\nProudie, the ne\\'er-do-weel canon\\'s family (the Stanhopes), and others\\r\\nstand out against an interest, not intense but sufficient, of story, a\\r\\ngreat variety of incident, and above all abundant and lifelike\\r\\nconversation. For many years, and in an extraordinary number of\\r\\nexamples, he fell little below, and perhaps once or twice went above,\\r\\nthis standard. It was rather a fancy <a name=\"Page_252\" id=\"Page_252\" />of his (one again, perhaps,\\r\\nsuggested by Thackeray) to run his books into series or cycles&mdash;the\\r\\nchief being that actually opened as above, and continuing through others\\r\\nto the brilliant <i>Last Chronicle of Barset</i> (1867), which in some\\r\\nrespect surpasses <i>Barchester Towers</i> itself, with a second series, not\\r\\nquite disconnected, dealing with Lady Glencora Palliser as centre, and\\r\\nyet others. His total production was enormous: it became in fact\\r\\nimpossibly so, and the work of his last <i>lustrum</i> and a little more (say\\r\\n1877-1882), though never exactly bad or painful to read, was obvious\\r\\nhack-work. But between <i>The Warden</i> and <i>The American Senator</i>,\\r\\ntwenty-two years later, he had written nearer thirty than twenty novels,\\r\\nof which at least half were much above the average and some quite\\r\\ncapital.<a id=\"footnotetag26\" name=\"footnotetag26\"></a><a href=\"#footnote26\"><sup>26</sup></a> Moreover, it is a noteworthy thing, and contrary to some\\r\\ncritical explanations, that, as his works drop out of copyright and are\\r\\nreprinted in cheap editions, they appear to be recovering very\\r\\nconsiderable popularity. This fact would seem to show that the manners,\\r\\nspeech, etc., represented in them have a certain standard quality which\\r\\ndoes not&mdash;like the manner, speech, etc., of novels such as those of Hook\\r\\nand Surtees&mdash;lose appeal to fresh generations; and that the artist who\\r\\ndealt with them must have had not a little faculty of fixing them in the\\r\\npresentation. In fact it is probably not too much to say that of the\\r\\n<i>average</i> novel of the third quarter of the century&mdash;in a more than\\r\\naverage but not of an extraordinary, transcendental, or quintessential\\r\\ncondition&mdash;Anthony Trollope is about as good a representative as can be\\r\\nfound. His talent is individual enough, <a name=\"Page_253\" id=\"Page_253\" />but not too individual: system\\r\\nand writer may each have the credit due to them allotted without\\r\\ndifficulty.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A novelist who might have been in front of the first flight of these in\\r\\npoint of time, and who is actually put by some in the first flight in\\r\\npoint of merit, is Mrs. Gaskell. Born in 1810, she accumulated the\\r\\nmaterial for her future <i>Cranford</i> at Knutsford in Cheshire: but did not\\r\\npublish this till after Dickens had, in 1850, established <i>Household\\r\\nWords</i>, where it appeared in instalments. She had a little earlier, in\\r\\n1848, published her first novel, <i>Mary Barton</i>&mdash;a vivid but distinctly\\r\\none-sided picture of factory life in Lancashire. In the same year with\\r\\nthe collected <i>Cranford</i> (1853) appeared <i>Ruth</i>, also a &quot;strife-novel&quot;\\r\\n(as the Germans would say) though in a different way: and two years\\r\\nlater what is perhaps her most elaborate effort, <i>North and South</i>. A\\r\\nyear or two before her death in 1865 <i>Sylvia\\'s Lovers</i> was warmly\\r\\nwelcomed by some: and the unfinished <i>Wives and Daughters</i>, which was\\r\\nactually interrupted by that death, has been considered her maturest\\r\\nwork. Her famous and much controverted <i>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</i> does\\r\\nnot belong to us, except in so far as it knits the two novelists\\r\\ntogether.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From hints dropped already, it may be seen that the present writer does\\r\\nnot find Mrs. Gaskell his easiest subject. There is much in her work\\r\\nwhich, in Hobbes\\'s phrase, is both &quot;an effect of power and a cause of\\r\\npleasure&quot;: but there appears to some to be in her a pervading want of\\r\\nactual success&mdash;of <i>r&eacute;ussite</i>&mdash;absolute and unquestionable. The sketches\\r\\nof <i>Cranford</i> are very agreeable and very admirable performances in the\\r\\nmanner first definitely thrown out by Addison, and turned to consummate\\r\\nperfection in the way of the regular novel (which be it remembered\\r\\n<i>Cranford</i> is not) by Miss Austen. But the mere mention of the last\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_254\" id=\"Page_254\" />name kills them. The author of <i>Emma</i> would have treated Miss Matty and\\r\\nthe rest much less lovingly, but she would have made them persons. Mrs.\\r\\nGaskell has left them mere types of amiable country-townishness in\\r\\nrespectable if not very lively times. Excessive respectability cannot be\\r\\ncharged against <i>Mary Barton</i> and <i>Ruth</i>, but here the &quot;problem&quot;&mdash;the\\r\\n&quot;purpose&quot;&mdash;interposes its evil influence: and we have got to take a side\\r\\nwith men or with masters, with selfish tempters of one class and deluded\\r\\nmaidens of another. <i>North and South</i> is perhaps on the whole the best\\r\\nplace in which to study Mrs. Gaskell\\'s art: for <i>Wives and Daughters</i> is\\r\\nunfinished and the books just named are tentatives. It begins by laying\\r\\na not inconsiderable hold on the reader: and, as it is worked out at\\r\\ngreat length, the author has every opportunity of strengthening and\\r\\nimproving that hold. It is certain that, in some cases, she does not do\\r\\nthis: and the reason is the same&mdash;the failure to project and keep in\\r\\naction definite and independent characters, and the attempt to make\\r\\nweight and play with purposes and problems. The heroine\\'s father&mdash;who\\r\\nresigns his living and exposes his delicate wife and only daughter, if\\r\\nnot exactly to privation, to discomfort and, in the wife\\'s case, fatally\\r\\nunsuitable surroundings, because of some never clearly defined\\r\\ndissatisfaction with the creed of the Church (<i>not</i> apparently with\\r\\nChristianity as such or with Anglicanism as such), and who dies\\r\\n&quot;promiscuously,&quot; to be followed, in equally promiscuous fashion, by a\\r\\nfriend who leaves his daughter Margaret a fortune&mdash;is one of those\\r\\nnearly contemptible imbeciles in whom it is impossible to take an\\r\\ninterest. In respect to the wife Mrs. Gaskell commits the curious\\r\\nmistake of first suggesting that she is a complainer about nothing, and\\r\\nthen showing her to us as a suffering victim of her husband\\'s <a name=\"Page_255\" id=\"Page_255\" />folly and\\r\\nof hopeless disease. The lover (who is to a great extent a replica of\\r\\nthe masterful mill-owner in <i>Shirley</i>) is uncertain and impersonal: and\\r\\nthe minor characters are null. One hopes, for a time, that Margaret\\r\\nherself will save the situation: but she goes off instead of coming on,\\r\\nand has rather less individuality and convincingness at the end of the\\r\\nstory than at the beginning. In short, Mrs. Gaskell seems to me one of\\r\\nthe chief illustrations of the extreme difficulty of the domestic\\r\\nnovel&mdash;of the necessity of exactly proportioning the means at command to\\r\\nthe end to be achieved. Her means were, perhaps, greater than those of\\r\\nmost of her brother-and-sister-novelists, but she set them to loose\\r\\nends, to ends too high for her, to ends not worth achieving: end thus\\r\\nproduced (again as it seems to me) flawed and unsatisfactory work. She\\r\\n&quot;means&quot; well in Herbert\\'s sense of the word: but what is meant is not\\r\\nquite done.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To mention special books and special writers is not the first object of\\r\\nthis survey, though it would be very easy to double and redouble its\\r\\nsize by doing this, even within the time-limits of this, the last, and\\r\\nthe next chapters. It may, however, be added that in this remarkable\\r\\ncentral period, and in the most central part of it from 1840 to 1860,\\r\\nthere appeared the first remarkable novel of Mr. George Meredith, <i>The\\r\\nOrdeal of Richard Feverel</i> (1859), first of a brilliant series that was\\r\\nto illustrate the whole remaining years of the century; and the isolated\\r\\nmasterpiece of <i>Phantastes</i>, which another prolific writer, George\\r\\nMacdonald, was never to repeat; while Mrs. Oliphant and Mrs. Craik, both\\r\\nof whom will also reappear in the next chapter, began as early as 1849.\\r\\nIn 1851 appeared the first of two remarkable books, <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The\\r\\nRomany Rye</i>, in which George Borrow, if he did not exactly create,\\r\\nbrought to perfec<a name=\"Page_256\" id=\"Page_256\" />tion from some points of view what may be called the\\r\\nautobiographic novel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Indeed the memory of the aged and the industry of the young could recall\\r\\nor rediscover dozens and scores of noteworthy books, some of which have\\r\\nnot lost actual or traditional reputation, such as the <i>Paul Ferroll</i>\\r\\n(1855) of Mrs. Archer Clive, a well-restrained crime-novel, the story of\\r\\nwhich is indicated in the title of its sequel, <i>Why Paul Ferroll killed\\r\\nhis Wife</i>. Henry Kingsley, George Alfred Lawrence, Wilkie Collins, and\\r\\nothers began their careers at this time. The best book ever written\\r\\nabout school, <i>Tom Brown\\'s School Days</i> (1857), and the best book in\\r\\nlighter vein ever written about Oxford, <i>Mr. Verdant Green</i> (1853-1856),\\r\\nboth appeared in the fifties.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Although, indeed, the intenser and more individual genius of the great\\r\\nnovelists of this time went rather higher than the specialist novel, it\\r\\nwas, in certain directions, well cultivated during this period. Men\\r\\nlikely to write naval novels of merit were dying out, and though Lever\\r\\ntook up the military tale, at second hand, with brilliant results, the\\r\\nsame historical causes were in operation there. But a comparatively new\\r\\nkind&mdash;the &quot;sporting&quot; novel&mdash;developed itself largely and in some cases\\r\\nwent beyond mere sport. Such early books as Egan\\'s <i>Tom and Jerry</i>\\r\\n(1821) can hardly be called novels: but as the love of sport extended\\r\\nand the term itself ceased to designate merely on the one side the\\r\\npleasures of country squires, and on the other the amusements (sometimes\\r\\nrather blackguard in character) of men about town, the general subject\\r\\nmade a lodgment in fiction. One of its most characteristic practitioners\\r\\nwas Robert Smith Surtees, who, before Dickens and perhaps acting as\\r\\nsuggester of the original plan of <i>Pickwick</i> (<i>not</i> that which Dickens\\r\\nsubstituted), excogitated (between 1831 <a name=\"Page_257\" id=\"Page_257\" />and 1838) the remarkable\\r\\nfictitious personage of &quot;Mr. Jorrocks,&quot; grocer and sportsman, whose\\r\\nadventures, and those of other rather hybrid characters of the same\\r\\nkind, he pursued through a number of books for some thirty years. These\\r\\n(though in strict character, and in part of their manners, deficient as\\r\\nabove noticed) were nearly always readable&mdash;and sometimes very\\r\\namusing&mdash;even to those who are not exactly Nimrods: and they were\\r\\ngreatly commended to others still by the admirable illustrations of\\r\\nLeech. There is not a little sound sport in Kingsley and afterwards in\\r\\nAnthony Trollope: while the novels of Frank Smedley, <i>Frank Fairlegh</i>\\r\\n(1850), <i>Lewis Arundel</i> (1852), and <i>Harry Coverdale\\'s Courtship</i>\\r\\n(1855), mix a good deal more of it with some good fun and some rather\\r\\nrococo romance. The subject became, indeed, very popular in the fifties,\\r\\nand entered largely into, though it by no means exclusively occupied,\\r\\nthe novels of George John Whyte-Melville, a Fifeshire gentleman, an\\r\\nEtonian, and a guardsman, who, after retiring from the army, served\\r\\nagain in the Crimean War, and, after writing a large number of novels,\\r\\nwas killed in the hunting field. Some of Whyte-Melville\\'s books, such as\\r\\n<i>Market Harborough</i> (1861), are hunting novels pure and simple, so much\\r\\nso that it has been said (rashly) that none but hunting men and women\\r\\ncan read them. Others, such as <i>Kate Coventry</i> (1856), a very lively and\\r\\nagreeable book, mix sport with general character and manners-painting.\\r\\nOthers, such as <i>Holmby House</i> (1860), <i>The Queen\\'s Maries</i> (1862),\\r\\netc., attempt the historical style. But perhaps this mixed novel of\\r\\nsport, society, and a good deal of love-making reached its most curious\\r\\ndevelopment in the novels of George Alfred Lawrence, from the once\\r\\nfamous <i>Guy Livingstone</i> (1857) onwards&mdash;a series almost typical, which\\r\\nwas developed further, with touches of original but <a name=\"Page_258\" id=\"Page_258\" />uncritical talent,\\r\\nwhich often dropped into unintentional caricature, by the late &quot;Ouida&quot;\\r\\n(Louise de La Ram&eacute;e). All the three last writers mentioned, however,\\r\\nespecially the last two, made sport only an ingredient in their novel\\r\\ncomposition (&quot;Ouida,&quot; in fact, knew nothing about it) and at least\\r\\nendeavoured, according to their own ideas and ideals, to grapple with\\r\\nlarger parts of life. The danger of the kind showed less in them than in\\r\\nsome imitators of a lower class, of whom Captain Hawley Smart was the\\r\\nchief, and a chief sometimes better than his own followers. Some even of\\r\\nhis books are quite interesting: but in a few of them, and in more of\\r\\nother writers, the obligation to tell something like a story and to\\r\\nprovide something like characters seems to be altogether forgotten. A\\r\\nrun (or several runs) with the hounds, a steeplechase and its\\r\\npreparations and accidents, one at least of the great races and the\\r\\ntraining and betting preliminary to them&mdash;these form the real and almost\\r\\nthe sole staple of story; so that a tolerably intelligent office-boy\\r\\ncould make them up out of a number or two of the <i>Field</i>, a sufficient\\r\\nlist of proper names, and a commonplace book of descriptions. This, in\\r\\nfact, is the danger of the specialist novel generally: though perhaps it\\r\\ndoes not show quite so glaringly in other cases. Yet, even here, that\\r\\nnote of the fiction of the whole century&mdash;its tendency to &quot;accaparate&quot;\\r\\nand utilise all the forms of life, all the occupations and amusements of\\r\\nmankind&mdash;shows itself notably enough.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, too, one notable book has, here even more than elsewhere, often set\\r\\ngoing hosts of imitations. <i>Tom Brown\\'s School Days</i>, for instance\\r\\n(1857), flooded the market with school stories, mostly very bad. But\\r\\nthere is one division which did more justice to a higher class of\\r\\nsubject and produced some very remarkable work in what is called the\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_259\" id=\"Page_259\" />religious novel, though, here as elsewhere, the better examples did not\\r\\nmerely harp on one string.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A very interesting off-shoot of the domestic novel, ignored or despised\\r\\nby the average critic and rather perfunctorily treated even by those who\\r\\nhave taken it as a special subject, is the &quot;Tractarian&quot; or High-Church\\r\\nnovel, which, originating very shortly after the movement itself had\\r\\nbegan, had no small share in popularising it. The earlier Evangelicals\\r\\nhad by no means neglected fiction as a means of propagating their views,\\r\\nespecially among the young. Mrs. Sherwood in <i>Little Henry and his\\r\\nBearer</i> and <i>The Fairchild Family</i> (1818) and &quot;Charlotte Elizabeth&quot;\\r\\n(Browne or Tonna) are examples. But the High-Church party, in accordance\\r\\nwith its own predecessors and patterns in the seventeenth century,\\r\\nalways maintained, during its earlier and better period, a higher\\r\\nstandard of scholarship and of general literary culture. Its early\\r\\nefforts in fiction&mdash;according to the curious and most interesting law\\r\\nwhich seems to decree that every subdivision of a kind shall go through\\r\\nsomething like the vicissitudes of the kind at large&mdash;were not strictly\\r\\nnovels but romance, and romance of the allegorical kind. In the late\\r\\nthirties and early forties the allegorists, the chief of whom were\\r\\nSamuel Wilberforce and William Adams, were busy and effective. The\\r\\nfuture bishop\\'s <i>Agathos</i> (before 1840) is a very spirited and\\r\\nwell-written adaptation of the &quot;whole armour of God&quot; theme so often\\r\\nre-allegorised: and Adams\\'s <i>Shadow of the Cross</i> is only the best of\\r\\nseveral good stories&mdash;of a rather more feminine type, but graceful,\\r\\nsound enough in a general way, and combining the manners of Spenser and\\r\\nBunyan with no despicable skill. If, however, the Tractarian\\r\\nfiction-writers had confined themselves to allegory there would be no\\r\\nnecessity to do more than glance at them, for allegory, on <a name=\"Page_260\" id=\"Page_260\" />the obvious\\r\\nBiblical suggestion, has been a constant instrument of combined\\r\\nreligious instruction and pastime. But they went much further afield.\\r\\nSometimes the excursions were half satirical, as in the really amusing\\r\\n<i>Owlet of Owlstone Edge</i> and <i>The Curate of Cumberworth and the Vicar of\\r\\nRoost</i> of Francis Paget, attacking, the slovenly neglect and supineness\\r\\nwhich, quite as much as unsound doctrine, was the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of the\\r\\nearly Anglo-Catholics. William Gresley and others wrote stories mostly\\r\\nfor the young. But the distinguishing feature of the school, and that\\r\\nwhich gives it an honourable and more than an honorary place here, was\\r\\nthe shape which, before the middle of the century, it took in the hands\\r\\nof two ladies, Elizabeth Sewell and Charlotte Mary Yonge.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first, who was the elder but survived Miss Yonge and died at a very\\r\\ngreat age quite recently, had much less talent than her junior: but\\r\\nundoubtedly deserves the credit of setting the style. In her novels\\r\\n(<i>Gertrude, Katharine Ashton</i>, etc.) she carried, even farther than Miss\\r\\nAusten, the principle of confining herself rigidly to the events of\\r\\nordinary life. Not that she eschews the higher middle or even the higher\\r\\nclasses: though, on the other hand, Katharine Ashton, evidently one of\\r\\nher favourite heroines, is the daughter of a shopkeeper. But the law of\\r\\naverage and ordinary character, incident, atmosphere, is observed almost\\r\\ninvariably. Unfortunately Miss Sewell (she was actually a\\r\\nschoolmistress) let the didactic part of her novels get rather too much\\r\\nthe upper hand: and though she wrote good English, possessed no special\\r\\ngrace of style, and little faculty of illustration or ornament from\\r\\nhistory, literature, her own fancy, current fashions, even of the most\\r\\nharmless kind, and so forth. The result is that her books have a certain\\r\\ndead-aliveness&mdash;that the characters, though actually <a name=\"Page_261\" id=\"Page_261\" />alive, are neither\\r\\ninterestingly alive nor, as Miss Austen had made hers, interesting in\\r\\ntheir very uninterestingness. Sometimes, for a scene or two, her truth\\r\\nto nature and fact is rewarded by that curious sense of recognition\\r\\nwhich the reader feels in the presence of actual <i>mimesis</i>&mdash;of creation\\r\\nof fictitious fact and person. But this is not common: and the epithet\\r\\n&quot;dull,&quot; which too commonly only stigmatises the person using it, may\\r\\nreally suggest itself not seldom in reference to Miss Sewell. A &quot;success\\r\\nof esteem&quot; is about the utmost that can be accorded her.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With Miss Yonge the case was very different. She was a lady of wide\\r\\nreading and, even according to the modern rather arbitrary restrictions\\r\\nof the term, something of an historical scholar; she had humour, of\\r\\nwhich there was scarcely a particle in Miss Sewell\\'s composition; she\\r\\nhad a very considerable understanding, and consequently some toleration\\r\\nof the infinite varieties, and at least the more venial foibles, of\\r\\nhuman temperament. She possessed an inexhaustible command of dialogue\\r\\nwhich was always natural and sometimes very far from trivial; and if she\\r\\nhad no command of the greater novelists\\' imagination in the creation of\\r\\ncharacter and story, she had an almost uncanny supply of invention, of\\r\\nwhat may be called the second or third class, in these respects. She\\r\\nwrote too much and too long; but it cannot be said that she ever merely\\r\\nrepeated herself. And her best books&mdash;the famous <i>Heir of Redclyffe</i>\\r\\n(1853), which captivated William Morris and his friends at Oxford, and\\r\\nwhich, with a little unnecessary sentimentality and a little\\r\\n&quot;unco-guidness,&quot; is full of cleverness, nature, good sense, good taste,\\r\\nand good form; <i>Heartsease</i> (1854), perhaps the best of all; <i>Dynevor\\r\\nTerrace</i> (1857), less of a general favourite but full of good things;\\r\\nand the especially popular <i>Daisy Chain</i> (1856), with not a <a name=\"Page_262\" id=\"Page_262\" />few\\r\\nothers&mdash;are things which no courageous and catholic critic of fiction\\r\\nwill ever be tired of defending or (which is not always the same thing)\\r\\nof reading. Some of her early tales, before these, were a little &quot;raw&quot;:\\r\\nand most of her later work showed (as did Anthony Trollope\\'s and that of\\r\\nother though not all very prolific novelists) that the field had been\\r\\novercropped. But she was hardly ever dull: and she always had that\\r\\nquality&mdash;if not of the supreme artist, of the real craftsman&mdash;which\\r\\nprevents a thing from being a failure. What is meant is done: though\\r\\nperhaps it might have been meant higher.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The comparison, backwards and forwards, of this great company of novels\\r\\nis of endless interest; perhaps one of many aspects of that interest may\\r\\nbe touched on specially, because it connects itself with much else that\\r\\nhas been said. If we read, together or in near sequence, three such\\r\\nbooks as, say, <i>Emilia Wyndbam, Pendennis</i>, and <i>Yeast</i>, all of which\\r\\nappeared close together, between 1846 and 1849, the differences, in\\r\\nquality and volume of individual genius, will of course strike every one\\r\\nforcibly. But some will also be struck by something else&mdash;the difference\\r\\nbetween the first and the other two in <i>style</i> or (as that word is\\r\\nalmost hopelessly ambiguous) let us perhaps say <i>diction</i>. Both\\r\\nThackeray and Kingsley are almost perfectly modern in this. We may not\\r\\nspeak so well to-day, and we may have added more slang and jargon to our\\r\\nspeech, but there is no real difference, except in these respects,\\r\\nbetween a speech of Pen\\'s (when not talking book) or one of Colonel\\r\\nBracebridge\\'s, and the speech of any gentleman who is a barrister or a\\r\\nguardsman at this hour. The excellent Mrs. Marsh had not arrived at that\\r\\npoint; what some people call the &quot;stilted&quot; forms and phrases of fifty or\\r\\nalmost a hundred years earlier clung to her still. The resulting lingo\\r\\nis far <a name=\"Page_263\" id=\"Page_263\" />better than that part of the lingo of to-day where literary and\\r\\nlinguistic good manners have been forgotten altogether: but it is\\r\\ndistinctly deficient in <i>ease</i>. There are endless flourishes and\\r\\nperiphrases&mdash;the colloquialisms which Swift and others had denounced\\r\\n(and quite properly) in their ugliest and vulgarest forms are not even\\r\\npermitted entrance in improved and warranted varieties. You must never\\r\\nsay &quot;won\\'t&quot; but always &quot;will not,&quot; whereas the ability to use the two\\r\\nforms adds infinite propriety as well as variety to the dialogue. You\\r\\nsay, &quot;At length a most unfortunate accident aggravated (if aggravation\\r\\nwere possible) the unfortunate circumstances of the situation.&quot; You\\r\\naddress your own characters in the oratorical manner of Mr. Burke and\\r\\nother great men, &quot;Ah, Mr. Danby! if instead, etc.&quot; In short, instead of\\r\\nreserving the grand manner (and a rather different grand manner) for\\r\\ngrand occasions, you maintain a sort of cheap machine-made kind of it\\r\\nthroughout. The real secret of the novel was not found out till this was\\r\\ndiscarded. Perhaps that real secret does not lie so much anywhere else\\r\\nas here.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A few words may not improperly be said about some of the circumstances\\r\\nand details of novel-appearance and distribution, etc., at this palmy\\r\\nday of English fiction. At what time the famous &quot;three-decker&quot; was\\r\\nconsecrated as the regular novel line-of-battle-ship I have not been\\r\\nable to determine exactly to my own satisfaction. Richardson had\\r\\nextended his interminable narrations to seven or eight volumes: Miss\\r\\nBurney latterly had not been content with less than five. From the\\r\\nspecimens I have examined, I have an idea that with the &quot;Minerva Press&quot;\\r\\nand its contemporaries and successors at the end of the eighteenth and\\r\\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, <i>four</i> was a very favourite if not\\r\\nthe most usual number. But these <a name=\"Page_264\" id=\"Page_264\" />volumes were usually small&mdash;not much\\r\\nlarger than those of the Belgian reprints of Dumas which, as one\\r\\nremembers, used to run into the dozen or something like it in the case\\r\\nof his longer books. Three, however, has obvious advantages; the chief\\r\\nof them being the adjustment to &quot;beginning, middle, and end,&quot; though\\r\\nthere is a corresponding disadvantage which soon developed itself&mdash;and\\r\\nin fact, finally, I have no doubt helped to ruin the form&mdash;the\\r\\ntemptation to make the <i>second</i> volume a place of mere padding. But the\\r\\nactual popularity of &quot;the old three-decker&quot; continued for quite two\\r\\ngenerations, if not more, and was unmistakable. Library subscriptions\\r\\nwere generally adjusted to it; and any circulating-library keeper would\\r\\ntell you that, putting this quite aside, even subscribers to more or\\r\\nfewer volumes than three would take the three-volume by preference. More\\r\\nthan this, still, there is a curious fact necessarily known to\\r\\ncomparatively few people. Although it was improper of Mr. Bludyer to\\r\\nsell his novel, and dine and drink of the profits before &quot;smashing&quot; it,\\r\\nthere were probably not many reviewers who did not get rid of most of\\r\\ntheir books of this kind, if for no other reasons than that no house,\\r\\nshort of a palace, would have held them all. And, in the palmy days of\\r\\ncirculating libraries, the price given by second-hand booksellers for\\r\\nnovels made a very considerable addition to the reviewer\\'s remuneration\\r\\nor guerdon. But these booksellers would not pay, in proportion, for two\\r\\nor one volume books&mdash;alleging, what no doubt was true, that the\\r\\nlibraries had a lower tariff for them. Further, the short story, now so\\r\\npopular, was very <i>un</i>popular in those days: and library customers would\\r\\nrefuse collections of them with something like indignation or disgust.\\r\\nIndeed, there are reviewers living who may perhaps pride themselves on\\r\\nhaving done something to drive the dislike out and the liking in.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_265\" id=\"Page_265\" />The circulating library itself, though not the creation of the novel,\\r\\nwas very largely extended by it, and helped no doubt very largely to\\r\\nextend the circulation of the novel in turn. Before it, to some extent,\\r\\nand long before so-called &quot;public&quot; or &quot;free&quot; libraries, books in general\\r\\nand novels in particular had been very largely diffused by clubs,\\r\\n&quot;institutions,&quot; and other forms of co-operative individual enterprise,\\r\\nthe bookplates of which will be found in many a copy of an old novel\\r\\nnow. Sometimes these were purely private associations of neighbours:\\r\\nsometimes they belonged to more or less extensive establishments, like\\r\\nthat defunct &quot;Russell Institution in Great Coram Street,&quot; which a great\\r\\nauthor, who was its neighbour, once took for an example of desolation;\\r\\nor the still existing and flourishing &quot;Philosophical&quot; examples in\\r\\nEdinburgh and Bath. In these latter cases, of course, novels were not\\r\\nallowed to be the main constituents of the library; in fact in some, but\\r\\nfew, they may have been sternly excluded. On the other hand, the\\r\\nprivate-adventure circulating libraries tended more and more, with few\\r\\nexceptions, to rely on novels only&mdash;&quot;Mudie\\'s&quot; and a few more being\\r\\nexceptions. Very few people, I suppose, ever bought three-volume novels;\\r\\nand the fact that they went almost wholly to the libraries, and were\\r\\nthere worn to pieces, accounts for the comparative rarity of good\\r\\ncopies. The circulating library has survived both the decease of the\\r\\nthree-volume novel and the competition of the so-called free library.\\r\\nBut it is pretty certain that it was a chief cause&mdash;and almost the whole\\r\\n<i>sustaining</i> cause&mdash;of the three-volume system itself. Nor was the\\r\\nconnection between nature of form and system of distribution limited to\\r\\nEngland: for the single-volume novel, though older in France than with\\r\\nus, is not so very old.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_266\" id=\"Page_266\" />But a very considerable proportion of these famous books made\\r\\nappearances previous to that in three volumes, and not distantly\\r\\nconnected with their popularity. For the most part these previous\\r\\nappearances were either in magazines or periodicals of one kind and\\r\\nanother, or else in &quot;parts.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Neither process was exactly new, though both were largely affected\\r\\nby changed conditions of general literature and life. The\\r\\nmagazine-appearance traces itself, by almost insensible gradations, to\\r\\nthe original periodical-essay of the Steele-Addison type&mdash;the small\\r\\nindividual bulk of which necessitated division of whatsoever was not\\r\\nitself on a very small scale. If you run down the &quot;Contents&quot; of the\\r\\n<i>British Essayists</i> you will constantly find &quot;Continuation of the story\\r\\nof Alonso and Imoinda&quot; and the like. But when, in the early years of the\\r\\nnineteenth century, the system of newspapers and periodicals branched\\r\\nout into endless development, coincidently with the increase of demand\\r\\nand supply in regard to the novel, it was inevitable that this latter\\r\\nshould be drawn upon to supply at once the standing dishes and the\\r\\nrelishes of the entertainment. <i>Blackwood</i> and the <i>London</i>, the first\\r\\nfruits of the new kind, did not at once take to the novel by\\r\\ninstalments: and the <i>London</i> had no time to do so. But <i>Blackwood</i>\\r\\nsoon became celebrated&mdash;a reputation which it has never lost&mdash;for the\\r\\nexcellence of its short stories, and by degrees took to long ones; while\\r\\nits followers&mdash;<i>Fraser, Bentley\\'s Miscellany, The Dublin University\\r\\nMagazine</i>, the <i>New Monthly</i>, and others&mdash;almost from the first bated\\r\\ntheir hooks with this new <i>app&acirc;t</i>. A very large proportion of the work\\r\\nof the novelists mentioned in the last chapter, as well as of Lever,\\r\\nappeared in one or other of these. <i>Fraser</i> in particular was\\r\\nThackeray\\'s chief refuge in the Days of Ignorance of <a name=\"Page_267\" id=\"Page_267\" />the public as to\\r\\nhis real powers and merits, while, just as he was going off, the very\\r\\ndifferent work of Kingsley came on there. And the tradition, as is well\\r\\nknown, has never been broken. The particular magazines may have died in\\r\\nsome cases: but the magazine-appearance of novels is nearly as vivacious\\r\\nas ever.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Publication in parts is nearly as old, but has a less continuous\\r\\nhistory, and has seen itself suffer an interruption of life. There are\\r\\nscattered examples of it pretty far back both in France and England.\\r\\nMarivaux had a particular fancy for it: with the result that he left not\\r\\na little of his work unfinished. Such volume-publication as that of\\r\\n<i>Tristram Shandy</i>, in batches really small in quantity and at fairly\\r\\nregular if long intervals, is not much different from part-issue. As the\\r\\ntaste for reading spread to classes with not much ready money, and\\r\\nperhaps, in some cases, living at a distance from libraries, this taste\\r\\nspread too. But I do not think there can be much doubt that the immense\\r\\nsuccess of Dickens&mdash;in combination with his own very distinct\\r\\npredilection for keeping the ring himself and being his own editor&mdash;had\\r\\nmost to do with its prevalence during the period under present\\r\\nconsideration. Thackeray took up the practice from him: as well as\\r\\nothers both from him and from Thackeray. The great illustrators, too, of\\r\\nthe forties, fifties, and sixties, from Cruikshank and Browne to\\r\\nFrederick Walker, were partly helped by the system, partly helped to\\r\\nmake it popular. But the circulating libraries did not like it for\\r\\nobvious reasons, the parts being fragile and unsubstantial: and the\\r\\ngreat success of cheap magazines, on the pattern of <i>Macmillan\\'s</i> and\\r\\nthe <i>Cornhill</i>, cut the ground from under its feet. The last remarkable\\r\\nnovel that I remember seeing in the form was <i>The Last Chronicle of\\r\\nBarset. Middlemarch</i> and <i>Daniel Deronda</i><a name=\"Page_268\" id=\"Page_268\" /> came out in parts which were\\r\\nrather volumes than parts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This piece-meal publication, whether in part or periodical, could not be\\r\\nwithout some effects on the character of the production. These were\\r\\nneither wholly good nor wholly bad. They served to some extent to\\r\\ncorrect the tendency, mentioned above, of the three-volume novel to &quot;go\\r\\nto seed&quot; in the middle&mdash;to become a sort of preposterous sandwich with\\r\\nmeat on the outsides and a great slab of ill-baked and insipid bread\\r\\nbetween. For readers would not have stood this in instalments: you had\\r\\nto provide some bite or promise of bite in each&mdash;if possible&mdash;indeed to\\r\\nleave each off at an interesting point. But this itself rather tended to\\r\\na jumpy and ill-composed whole&mdash;to that mechanical shift from one part\\r\\nof the plot to another which is so evident, for instance, in Trollope:\\r\\nand there was worse temptation behind. If a man had the opportunity, the\\r\\nmeans, the courage, and the artistic conscience necessary to finish his\\r\\nwork before any part of it appeared, or at least to scaffold it\\r\\nthoroughly throughout in advance, no harm was done. But perhaps there is\\r\\nno class of people with whom the temptation&mdash;common enough in every\\r\\nclass&mdash;of hand-to-mouth work is more fatal than with men of letters. It\\r\\nis said that even the clergy are human enough to put off their\\r\\nsermon-writing till Saturday, and what can be expected of the profane\\r\\nman, especially when he has a whole month apparently before him? It is\\r\\npretty certain that Thackeray succumbed to this temptation: and so did a\\r\\ngreat many people who could much less afford to do so than Thackeray.\\r\\nIt was almost certainly responsible for part of the astonishing\\r\\nmedley of repetitions and lapses in Lever: and I am by no means\\r\\nsure that some of Dickens\\'s worst faults, especially the ostentatious\\r\\nplot-<a name=\"Page_269\" id=\"Page_269\" />that-is-no-plot of such a book as <i>Little Dorrit</i>&mdash;the plot which\\r\\nmarks time with elaborate gesticulation and really does not advance at\\r\\nall&mdash;were not largely due to the system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let it only be added that these expensive forms of publication by no\\r\\nmeans excluded cheap reprints as soon as a book was really popular. The\\r\\nvery big people kept up their prices: but everybody else was glad to get\\r\\ninto &quot;popular libraries,&quot; yellow-backed railway issues, and the like, as\\r\\nsoon as possible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It will have been seen that the present writer puts the novel of\\r\\n1845-1870 very high: he would indeed put it, in its own compartment,\\r\\nalmost on a level with the drama of 1585-1625 or the poems of 1798-1825.\\r\\nJust at the present moment there may be a pretty general tendency to\\r\\nconsider this allowance exaggerated if not preposterous: and to set it\\r\\ndown to the well-known foible of age for the period of its own youth.\\r\\nThere is no need to do more than suggest that those who were young when\\r\\nShakespeare, or when Byron, died, would not have been exactly in their\\r\\ndotage if, forty years later, they had extolled the literature of their\\r\\nnonage. One does not care to dwell long on such a point: but it may just\\r\\nbe observed that the present writer\\'s withers are hardly even pinched,\\r\\nlet alone wrung, by the strictest application, to his case, of this\\r\\nrather idle notion. For some of what he is praising as the best novels\\r\\nwere written before he was born; many while he was in the nursery; most\\r\\nbefore he had left school, and practically all before he had ceased to\\r\\nbe an undergraduate. Now acute observers know that what may be called\\r\\nthe disease of contemporary partisanship rarely even begins till the\\r\\nundergraduate period, and is at its severest from twenty-five to\\r\\nthirty-five. I would undertake that most of our reviewers who discover\\r\\nShakespeares and Sainte-Beuves, improved Thackerays <a name=\"Page_270\" id=\"Page_270\" />and bettered\\r\\nMoli&egrave;res, week by week or day by day, count their years between these\\r\\nlimits. <i>Beati illi</i> from some points of view, but from others, if they\\r\\ngo on longer, Heaven help them indeed!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But all this is really idle. A critic is not right or wrong because he\\r\\nis young or old as the case may be; because he follows the taste of his\\r\\nage or runs counter to it; because he likes the past or because he likes\\r\\nthe present. He is right or wrong according as he does or does not like\\r\\nthe right things in the right way. And it is a simple historical fact,\\r\\ncapable now of being seen in a proper perspective, and subjected to the\\r\\nproper historical tests, that, in the large sense, the two generations\\r\\nfrom the appearance of Scott and Miss Austen to the death of Dickens\\r\\n(and considering the ebb which followed Scott and Miss Austen\\r\\nthemselves, specially the latter of these two), supplied the spring tide\\r\\nof the novel-flood, the flower-time of its flowering season, the acme of\\r\\nits climax.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The comparison, both in the longer and shorter time, to the great summer\\r\\nof the drama may be too complimentary&mdash;I do not think it is, except in\\r\\nso far as that drama necessarily involved poetry, a higher thing by far\\r\\nthan either drama itself or novel&mdash;but it is certainly not an altogether\\r\\ncomfortable one. For we know that the drama, thereafter, has never had a\\r\\nmore than galvanised life, except in the imagination of the gentlemen\\r\\nwho discover Shakespeares and Moli&egrave;res as aforesaid. And there are those\\r\\nwho say that, not only at the moment, but for some time past, the state\\r\\nof the novel is, and has been, not much more promising. The student who\\r\\nis thoroughly broken to the study of literary history is never a\\r\\npessimist, though he may be very rarely an optimist: for the one thing\\r\\nof which he should be thoroughly convinced is its <a name=\"Page_271\" id=\"Page_271\" />incalculableness. But\\r\\nhe might admit&mdash;while reserving unlimited trust in the Wind of the\\r\\nSpirit and its power to blow exactly as it listeth, and to awaken the\\r\\ndryest of dry bones&mdash;that circumstances are not incompatible with\\r\\nsomething like a decay in the novel: just as they were with a decay in\\r\\nthe drama. The state of society and temper in the late sixteenth and\\r\\nearly seventeenth century&mdash;not too well regulated; stirred at once by\\r\\nthe sinking force of the medi&aelig;val and the rising force of the modern\\r\\nspirit; full of religious revival which had happily not gone wholly\\r\\nwrong, as it had in some other countries; finding ready to its hand a\\r\\nlanguage which had cast most of its sloughs of accidence and prosody,\\r\\nand was fresh, limber, ready for anything; enterprising but not buried\\r\\nin business&mdash;was favourable to the rise and flourishing of this\\r\\ndisorderly abundance of dramatic creation&mdash;tragic, comic, and in all the\\r\\nvarieties that <i>Hamlet</i> catalogues or satirises. The mid-nineteenth\\r\\ncentury had something of the same hot-bed characteristic, though\\r\\nsufficiently contrasted and fitted to produce a different growth. It\\r\\nhad, if at a little distance, the inspiriting memory of a great war,\\r\\nwhere the country had taken the most glorious part possible. It also had\\r\\na great religious revival, which had taken no coarse or vulgar form.\\r\\nAlthough the middle class had seized, and the lower classes were\\r\\nthreatening to seize, the government, even the former had not\\r\\nmonopolised the helm. There was in society, though it was not\\r\\nstrait-laced or puritanical, a general standard of &quot;good form.&quot;\\r\\nScholarship and knowledge of literature had not yet been exchanged for\\r\\n&quot;education&quot; and ignorance of letters. The national fancy for sport was\\r\\nin about its healthiest condition, emerging from one state of\\r\\nquestionableness and not yet plunged in another. The chair of the chief\\r\\nof <a name=\"Page_272\" id=\"Page_272\" />the kinds of literature&mdash;poetry&mdash;which always exercises a singular\\r\\ninfluence over the lower forms, was still worthily occupied and\\r\\nsurrounded. And, above all, the appetite for the novel was still eager,\\r\\nfresh, and not in the least sated, jaded, or arrived at that point when\\r\\nit has to be whetted by asafoetida on the plates or cigarettes between\\r\\nthe courses. Few better atmospheres could be even imagined for the\\r\\ncombined novel-romance&mdash;the story which, while it did not exclude the\\r\\nadventurous or even the supernatural in one sense, insisted on the\\r\\nrational in another, and opened its doors as wide as possible to every\\r\\nsubject, or combination of subjects, that would undertake to be\\r\\ninteresting. That the extraordinary reply made by genius and talent to\\r\\nthe demand thus created and encouraged should last indefinitely could\\r\\nnot be expected: that the demand itself should lead to overproduction\\r\\nand glut was certain. But, as we shall see, there was no sudden\\r\\ndecadence; the period even of best or nearly best production went on\\r\\nwith no important intermission; and was but yesterday still represented\\r\\nby two great names, is still represented by one, among the older\\r\\nwriters, by more than one or two names of credit among the middle-aged\\r\\nand younger. To these in some degree, and to those who have finished\\r\\ntheir career in the last thirty years to a greater, we must now turn.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"CHAPTER_VIII\" id=\"CHAPTER_VIII\" /><a name=\"Page_273\" id=\"Page_273\" />CHAPTER VIII</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>THE FICTION OF YESTERDAY&mdash;CONCLUSION</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In regard to a large part of the subject of the present chapter the\\r\\npresent writer possesses the knowledge of a reviewer, week by week and\\r\\nalmost day by day, of contemporary fiction between 1873 and 1895. It so\\r\\nhappened that the beginning of this period coincided very nearly with\\r\\nthe beginning of that slightly downward movement of the\\r\\nnineteenth-century novel which has been referred to at the end of the\\r\\nlast chapter: and he thus had opportunities of observing it all along\\r\\nits course, till we parted company. It must again, and most strongly, be\\r\\ninsisted that this &quot;downward movement,&quot; like such movements generally in\\r\\nliterature, is only so to be characterised with considerable provisos\\r\\nand allowances. Literary &quot;down-grades&quot; are not like the slopes of an\\r\\ninclined plane: they are like portions of a mountain range, in which\\r\\nisolated peaks may shoot up almost level with the very highest of the\\r\\ncentral group, but in which the table lands are lower, the <i>average</i>\\r\\nheight of the hills inferior, and the general sky-line a nearer and\\r\\nnearer approximation to the plain. At the actual death of Dickens there\\r\\nwas no reason for any one less hopelessly pessimist than Peacock\\'s Mr.\\r\\nToobad, or Sydney Smith\\'s Tuxford waiter, to take a gloomy view of the\\r\\nfuture of the novel. Of the greater novelists mentioned in the last\\r\\nchapter Charlotte Bront&euml; and Mrs. Gaskell were indeed dead, and if\\r\\nKingsley had not wholly ceased writing novels, he had, before ceasing,\\r\\ngiven signs that he had <a name=\"Page_274\" id=\"Page_274\" />better do so. Yet, at least to the admirers of\\r\\n&quot;George Eliot,&quot; she was at her most admirable; some of the very best\\r\\nstuff of Trollope was but just past, and some of all but his best was\\r\\nstill to appear; Charles Reade was writing busily with that curious\\r\\nunsatisfactory genius of his; others were well at work.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There was also no lack of newer comers. Mr. Meredith had been writing\\r\\nfor some dozen years: and though he had achieved no general popularity,\\r\\nthough even critics might make reserves as to points in his procedure,\\r\\nthere could be no competent doubt of his great powers. Mr. Blackmore had\\r\\nmade his late beginning some time before: and had just caught the public\\r\\near unmistakably with <i>Lorna Doone</i> (1869). Mr. Hardy was on the eve of\\r\\ncatching it with the new and powerful attractions of <i>Under the\\r\\nGreenwood Tree</i> (1872). In the heart of the sixties (1863-4-6), the\\r\\n<i>Chronicles of Carlingford</i> had seemed the promissory notes of a\\r\\nnovelist of the absolutely first class in Mrs. Oliphant, though somehow\\r\\nthe bills were rather renewed than met. Others to be noticed immediately\\r\\nhad come or were coming on. Let us take a little more detailed notice of\\r\\nthem.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the cases of Mr. Meredith and of Mr. Hardy&mdash;not to speak of others on\\r\\nwhom the bar still luckily rests&mdash;the &quot;great ox&quot; was, until the original\\r\\ncomposition of this book was actually finished, &quot;on the tongue&quot; of any\\r\\none who does not disregard the good old literary brocard &quot;<i>de</i> vivis\\r\\n<i>nil nisi</i> necessarium.&quot; You may and must criticise, with as much\\r\\nfreedom as consists with courtesy, the successive stages of the work of\\r\\nthe living master as he submits it to your judgment by publication. But\\r\\njustice no less than courtesy demands that, until the work is finished,\\r\\nand sealed as a whole&mdash;till the <i>ne varietur</i> and <i>ne plus ultra</i> of\\r\\ndeath have been set on it&mdash;you shall abstain from a more general\\r\\njudgment, which can <a name=\"Page_275\" id=\"Page_275\" />hardly be judicial, and which will have difficulty\\r\\nin steering between the fulsome if it be favourable and the uncivil if\\r\\nit be adverse. Fortunately there was little difficulty in any of our\\r\\nthree excepted cases. As has been already hinted in one case, the chorus\\r\\nof praise, ever since it made itself heard, has not been quite\\r\\nunchequered. It has been objected both to Mr. Meredith and to Mr. Hardy\\r\\nthat there is in them a note, perhaps to be detected also generally in\\r\\nthe later fiction which they have so powerfully influenced&mdash;the note of\\r\\na certain <i>perversity</i>&mdash;of an endeavour to be peculiar in thought, in\\r\\nstyle, in choice of subject, in handling of it; in short in general\\r\\nattitude. And with this has been connected&mdash;not in their cases with\\r\\nany important or really damaging effect, though undoubtedly so in regard\\r\\nto some of their followers&mdash;a suggestion that this &quot;perversity&quot; is the\\r\\nnote of a waning period&mdash;that just as the excessive desire to be <i>like</i>\\r\\nall the best models is the note of Classical decadence, so the excessive\\r\\ndesire to be <i>unlike</i> everything else is the note of Romantic\\r\\ndegeneration.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is truth in this, but it damages neither Mr. Meredith nor Mr.\\r\\nHardy on the whole; though it may supply a not altogether wholesome\\r\\ntemptation to some readers to admire them for the wrong things, and may\\r\\ninterpose a wholly unnecessary obstacle in the way of their full and\\r\\nfrank enjoyment by others. The intellectual power and the artistic skill\\r\\nwhich have been shown in the long series that has followed <i>The Ordeal\\r\\nof Richard Feverel</i>; the freshness and charm of the earlier, the\\r\\nstrenuous workmanship and original handling of the later, novels of the\\r\\nauthor of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> and of <i>Tess of the\\r\\nD\\'Urbervilles</i>, simply disable off-hand the judgment of the critic&mdash;and\\r\\nin fact annul his jurisdiction&mdash;if he fails to admire <a name=\"Page_276\" id=\"Page_276\" />them; while in\\r\\nsome cases universal, in many general, in all considerable and not\\r\\ntrivial delight has been given by them to generations of novel readers.\\r\\nAbove all, it may be said of both these veterans that they have held the\\r\\nstandard high, that&mdash;in Mr. Meredith\\'s case more specially and for a\\r\\nlonger preliminary period, but virtually in both&mdash;they have had to\\r\\nawait the taste for their work: and that in awaiting it they have never\\r\\nstooped for one moment to that dastardly and degrading change of sail to\\r\\ncatch the popular breeze, which has always been the greatest curse of\\r\\npolitics and of literature&mdash;the two chief worldly occupations and ends\\r\\nof the mind of man&mdash;that they have been and are artists who wait till\\r\\nthe world comes to them, and not artisans who haunt the market places to\\r\\nhire themselves out to the first comer who will pay their price, or even\\r\\nbate their price to suit the hirer. If it were possible to judge the\\r\\nliterary value of a period by its best representatives&mdash;which is\\r\\nexactly what is <i>not</i> possible&mdash;then the period 1870-1908 might, as far\\r\\nas novel-writing is concerned, point to these two names and say, &quot;These\\r\\nare mine; what does it matter what you choose to say against me?&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The foregoing remarks were actually written before Mr. Meredith\\'s death:\\r\\nand I have thought it better to leave them exactly as they then stood\\r\\nwith hardly any correction; but it may justly be expected that they\\r\\nshould now be supplemented. The history of Mr. Meredith\\'s career and\\r\\nreputation, during the half century which passed between the appearance\\r\\nof <i>Richard Feverel</i> and his death, has a certain obvious resemblance to\\r\\nthat of Browning\\'s, but with some differences. His work at once arrested\\r\\nattention, but it did not at once in all, or in many, cases fix it, even\\r\\nwith critical readers: and for a long time the general public turned an\\r\\nobstinately deaf ear. He <a name=\"Page_277\" id=\"Page_277\" />followed <i>The Ordeal</i> itself&mdash;a study of very\\r\\nfreely and deeply drawn character; of incident sometimes unusual and\\r\\nalways unusually told; of elaborate and disconcerting epigram or rather\\r\\nof style saturated with epigrammatic quality; and of a strange ironic\\r\\npersiflage permeating thought, picture, and expression in the same\\r\\nway&mdash;unhastingly but unrestingly with others. <i>Evan Harrington</i> (1861)\\r\\nis generally lighter in tone; and should be taken in connection with the\\r\\nten years later <i>Harry Richmond</i> as an example of what may be called a\\r\\nsort of new picaresque novel&mdash;the subjects being exalted from the\\r\\ngutter&mdash;at least the street gutter&mdash;to higher stories of the novel\\r\\nhouse. <i>Emilia in England</i> (1864), later called <i>Sandra Belloni</i>, and\\r\\nits sequel <i>Vittoria</i> (1866), embody, especially the latter, the\\r\\nItalomania of the mid-century. Between them <i>Rhoda Fleming</i> (1865),\\r\\nreturning to English country life, showed, with the old characteristics\\r\\nof expression, tragic power superior perhaps to that of the end of\\r\\n<i>Feverel</i>. In fact some have been inclined to put <i>Rhoda</i> at the head.\\r\\nIn 1875 <i>Beauchamp\\'s Career</i> showed the novelist\\'s curious fancy for\\r\\nstudying off actual contemporaries; for it is now perfectly well known\\r\\nwho &quot;Beauchamp&quot; was: and four years later came what the true Meredithian\\r\\nregards as the masterpiece, <i>The Egoist</i>. Two other books followed, to\\r\\nsome extent in the track of <i>Beauchamp\\'s Career, Diana of the Crossways</i>\\r\\n(1886), utilising the legend of Mrs. Norton\\'s betrayal of secrets, and\\r\\n<i>The Tragic Comedians</i> (1881), the story of the German socialist\\r\\nLassalle. The author\\'s prediction, never hurried, now slackened, and by\\r\\ndegrees ceased, but the nineties saw three books, <i>One of Our\\r\\nConquerors</i> (1891), <i>Lord Ormont and his Aminta</i> (1894), and <i>The\\r\\nAmazing Marriage</i> (1895).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No bibliography of Mr. Meredith being here necessary <a name=\"Page_278\" id=\"Page_278\" />or possible,\\r\\nsmaller and miscellaneous things need not detain us; and we are not\\r\\nconcerned with his sometimes charming verse. It is the character, and\\r\\nespecially the &quot;total-effect&quot; character, of the major novels with which\\r\\nwe have to do. This has been faintly adumbrated above, but the lines\\r\\nmust be a little deepened and the contour filled in to some extent here.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>By invoking (practically at the outset of his work) &quot;the Comic Spirit&quot;\\r\\nas the patron of his endeavours and the inspirer of his art, Mr.\\r\\nMeredith of course did no more than assert his claim to place himself in\\r\\nthe right race and lineage of Cervantes and Fielding. Nor, though the\\r\\nclaim be a bold one, can there be much dispute among competent judges\\r\\nthat he made it out. To the study, not in a frivolous or even merely\\r\\nsatirical, but in a gravely ironic mode, of the nature of humanity he\\r\\naddicted himself throughout: and the results of his studies undoubtedly\\r\\nenlarge humanity\\'s conscious knowledge of itself in the way of\\r\\nfictitious exemplification. In a certain sense no higher praise can be\\r\\ngiven. To acknowledge it is at once to estate him, not only with\\r\\nCervantes and Fielding themselves, but with Thackeray, with Swift, with\\r\\nMoliere, with Shakespeare. It places him well above Dickens, and, in the\\r\\nopinion of the present writer, it places him above even Balzac.\\r\\nBut there are points wherein, according to that same opinion, he\\r\\napproaches much nearer to Balzac and Dickens than to the other and\\r\\ngreater artistic creators: while in one of these points he stands\\r\\naloof even from these two, and occupies a position&mdash;not altogether to his\\r\\nadvantage&mdash;altogether by himself in his class of artistic creation. All\\r\\nthe six from Thackeray to Shakespeare&mdash;one might even go farther back\\r\\nand, taking a more paradoxical example, add Rabelais&mdash;are, even in\\r\\nextravaganza, in parody, <a name=\"Page_279\" id=\"Page_279\" />in what you please, at once pre-eminently and\\r\\n<i>prima facie</i> natural and human. To every competent human judgment, as\\r\\nsoon as it is out of its nonage, and barring individual\\r\\ndisqualifications of property or accident, this human nature attests\\r\\nitself. You may dislike some of its manifestations; you may decline or\\r\\nfail to understand others; but there it is, and there it is <i>first</i>. In\\r\\nBalzac and Dickens and Mr. Meredith it is not first. Of course it is\\r\\nthere to some extent and even to a large one: or they would not be the\\r\\ngreat writers that they are, or great writers at all. But it is not\\r\\nmerely disguised by separable clothings, as in Rabelais wholly and in\\r\\nparts of others, or accompanied, as in Swift and others still, by\\r\\ncompanions not invariably acceptable. It is to a certain extent\\r\\nadulterated, sophisticated, made not so much the helpmeet, or the\\r\\nwilling handmaid, of Art as its thrall, almost its butt. I do not know\\r\\nhow early criticism, which now seems to have got hold of the fact,\\r\\nnoticed the strong connection-contrast between Dickens and Meredith: but\\r\\nit must always have been patent to some. The contrast is of course the\\r\\nfirst to strike:&mdash;the ordinariness, in spite of his fantastic grotesque,\\r\\nof Dickens, and the extraordinariness of Meredith; the almost utter\\r\\nabsence of literature in Dickens, and the prominence of it in\\r\\nMeredith&mdash;divers other differences of the same general kind. But to any\\r\\none reflecting on the matter it should soon emerge that a spirit,\\r\\nkindred in some way, but informed with literature and anxious &quot;to be\\r\\ndifferent,&quot; starting too with Dickens\\'s example before him, might, and\\r\\nprobably would, half follow, half revolt into another vein of not\\r\\nanti- but extra-natural fantasy, such as that which the author of <i>The\\r\\nOrdeal of Richard Feverel</i> actually worked.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&quot;Extra- not anti-&quot; that is the key. The worlds of<a name=\"Page_280\" id=\"Page_280\" /> Dickens, of Balzac,\\r\\nand of Meredith are not impossible worlds: for the only worlds which are\\r\\nimpossible are those which are inconsistent with themselves, and none of\\r\\nthese is that. Something has been said of the &quot;four dimensions&quot; which\\r\\nare necessary to work Dickens\\'s world, and our business here is not with\\r\\nBalzac\\'s. But something must now be said of the fourth dimension&mdash;some\\r\\nwould say the fifth, sixth, and almost tenth dimensions&mdash;which is or are\\r\\nrequired to put Mr. Meredith\\'s in working order. I do not myself think\\r\\nthat more than a fourth is needed, and I have sometimes fancied that if\\r\\nMohammedan ideas of the other world be true, and an artist is obliged to\\r\\nendow all his fictitious creations with real life, it will be by the\\r\\nreduction and elimination of this dimension that Mr. Meredith will have\\r\\nto proceed. There will be great joy in that other world when he has done\\r\\nit: and, alarming as the task looks, I think it not impudent to say that\\r\\nno one who ever enjoyed his conversation will think it impossible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The intrusive element can, however, only be designated singly by rather\\r\\nenlarging the strict and usual sense of the term Style so as to include\\r\\nnot merely diction, but the whole manner of presentation&mdash;what, in\\r\\nshort, is intended by the French word <i>faire</i>. For this, or part of\\r\\nthis, he made, in relation to his poems, a sort of apology-explanation\\r\\nin the lines prefixed to the collected edition, and entitled &quot;The\\r\\nPromise in Disturbance.&quot; I am not sure that there is any single place\\r\\nwhere a parallel excuse-defiance musters itself up in the novels: but\\r\\nthere are scores (the prelude to <i>The Egoist</i> occurs foremost) where it\\r\\nis scattered about all of them; and it is certainly much more required\\r\\nthere. Indeed as far as the narrow sense of &quot;style&quot; goes, the\\r\\npeculiarity, whether they admit it to be a fault or not, is practically\\r\\nadmitted as a fact by all <a name=\"Page_281\" id=\"Page_281\" />but Meredith-monomaniacs. Here is a <i>sors\\r\\nMeredithiana</i>, taken from <i>Rhoda Fleming</i>, one of the simplest of the\\r\\nbooks:&mdash;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&quot;Algernon waited dinnerless until the stealthy going minutes distended\\r\\nand swelled monstrous and horrible as viper-bitten bodies, and the\\r\\nvenerable Signior Time became of unhealthy hue.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To match that&mdash;it would be exceedingly easy to match and beat it out of\\r\\nthe author himself&mdash;you must go to the maddest of the seventeenth-century\\r\\nmetaphysicals&mdash;say to Edward Benlowes himself. But this is nothing: it is\\r\\nat worst an obvious playful exaggeration, very like some things of\\r\\nDickens\\'s own transposed into another key. But take this opening of\\r\\nthe fifteenth chapter of <i>Diana of the Crossways</i>:&mdash;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&quot;The Gods of this world\\'s contests, against whom our poor stripped\\r\\nindividual is commonly in revolt, are, as we know, not miners, they are\\r\\nreapers; and if we appear no longer on the surface, they cease to bruise\\r\\nus: they will allow an arena character to be cleansed and made\\r\\npresentable while enthusiastic friends preserve discretion. It is of\\r\\ncourse less than magnanimity; they are not proposed to you for your\\r\\nworship; they are little Gods, temporary as that great wave, their\\r\\nparent human mass of the hour. But they have one worshipful element in\\r\\nthem, which is, the divine insistency upon there being two sides to a\\r\\ncase&mdash;to every case. And the People so far directed by them may boast of\\r\\nhealthfulness. Let the individual shriek, the innocent, triumphant, have\\r\\nin honesty to admit the fact. One side is vanquished according to decree\\r\\nof Law, but the superior Council does not allow it to be extinguished.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Here undoubtedly there is something more than a simile, an image, or a\\r\\n<i>pointe</i>; there is a thought, and the author\\'s <a name=\"Page_282\" id=\"Page_282\" />admirers would, I\\r\\nsuppose, rely triumphantly on it as a marriage of original thought and\\r\\nphrase. But is it so? Is the thought really anything more than the\\r\\nperfectly correct and obvious one that, if you let scandal alone it will\\r\\ndie, or at least go into abeyance? Does that thought really gain\\r\\nanything from being tricked out with not always very congruously\\r\\narranged paraphernalia of Gods, and arenas, and reapers, and miners, and\\r\\nthe People with a large P, and shrieks, and innocency, and the rest? A\\r\\npalate or an appetite so jaded that it cannot appreciate thought put\\r\\nbefore it plainly, or so sluggish that it requires to be stung or\\r\\npuzzled into thinking, may derive some advantage. But are these exactly\\r\\nthe tastes and appetites that should be accepted as arbiters?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Again, partly through this perpetual mirage and steam-cloud of style,\\r\\npartly by other methods, Mr. Meredith manages, with consummate\\r\\ncleverness no doubt, to colour his whole representation of character and\\r\\nstory in the same extra-natural way. Take the rick-burning at the\\r\\nbeginning of <i>Feverel</i>; take the famous wine scene (a very fascinating\\r\\none, though I never heard anywhere else, in some researches on the\\r\\nsubject, of port that would keep ninety years) in <i>The Egoist</i>. The\\r\\nthings may have happened this way in some Georgium Sidus, where the\\r\\nComic Spirit has arranged the proper Fourth Dimension: but that is not\\r\\nthe way they happen here. The Wise Youth, Diana, Edward Blancove, Roy\\r\\nRichmond&mdash;but why begin a list which would never end?&mdash;are inhabitants\\r\\nof the same region. They are not impossible: they could be translated\\r\\ninto actual tellurian beings, which the men and women of the bad\\r\\nnovelist never can be. But at present they are not translated: and you\\r\\nmust know a special language, in a wide sense, in order to translate\\r\\nthem. I do not <a name=\"Page_283\" id=\"Page_283\" />say that the language is impossible or even very hard to\\r\\nlearn: but it is required. And Meredithians say you ought to learn it.\\r\\nAn extremely respectable book of reference before me rebukes &quot;those who\\r\\nlack the intelligence and sensibility that can alone admit them to the\\r\\ncharmed circle of appreciative readers&quot; and who &quot;have not patience to\\r\\napply themselves to the study of the higher fiction with the same ardour\\r\\nthat they think necessary in the case of any other art.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now &quot;Fudge!&quot; is a rude word: but I fear we must borrow it from\\r\\nGoldsmith\\'s hero, and apply it here. As for &quot;charmed circles&quot; there is\\r\\nuncommonly good company outside them, where, as Beatrice says, we may\\r\\n&quot;be as merry as the day is long,&quot; so that the Comic Spirit cannot\\r\\nentirely disdain us. And as for art&mdash;the present writer will fight for\\r\\nits claims as long as he has breath. But the proof of the art of the\\r\\nnovelist is that&mdash;at first hand or very shortly&mdash;he &quot;enfists,&quot;\\r\\nabsorbs, delights you. You may discover secrets of his art afterwards\\r\\nwith much pleasure and profit: but the actual first-hand delight is the\\r\\ncriterion. There ought to be no need of sitting down before the thing\\r\\nwith tools and dynamite like burglars at a safe; of mustering crucibles\\r\\nand reagents like assayers at some doubtful and recalcitrant piece of\\r\\nore. Now these not very adept defenders of Mr. Meredith seem to assert\\r\\nthat these processes are desirable in any case, and necessary in his. As\\r\\na matter of fact the necessity is not omnipresent: but it is present far\\r\\ntoo frequently. It is the first duty of the novelist to &quot;let himself be\\r\\nread&quot;&mdash;anything else that he gives you is a <i>bonus</i>, a trimming, a\\r\\ndessert.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is not unamusing to those who regarded Mr. Meredith during almost his\\r\\nwhole career with those mingled feelings of the highest admiration and\\r\\nof critical reserve which this <a name=\"Page_284\" id=\"Page_284\" />notice has endeavoured to express, to\\r\\nnote a new phase which seems to be coming over the youngest criticism.\\r\\nThe original want of appreciation has passed, never, one may hope, to\\r\\nreturn; and the middle <i>engouement</i>, which was mainly engineered by\\r\\nthose doughty partisans, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Henley, is passing\\r\\nlikewise. But the most competent and generous juniors seem to be a\\r\\nlittle uncomfortable, to have to take a good deal on trust, and not\\r\\nquite to &quot;like the security.&quot; To those who know the history of critical\\r\\nopinion these signs speak pretty clearly, though not so as to authorise\\r\\nthem to anticipate the final judgment absolutely. Genius, all but of the\\r\\nhighest, can hardly be denied to Mr. Meredith: but it is genius marred,\\r\\nperhaps by unfortunate education, certainly by undue egotism, by a\\r\\ncertain Celtic <i>tapage</i>, and by a too painful and elaborate endeavour to\\r\\nbe unlike other people.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A very interesting subject for examination from the present point of\\r\\nview is Mr. Blackmore, because, on the one hand there is complete\\r\\n<i>parrhesia</i>, and on the other (here at least) enthusiastic admiration.\\r\\nFew of our modern novelists have combined so much scholarship with so\\r\\nmuch command of mother wit and racy English, so much close study of\\r\\nminor character and local speech with such wealth of romantic fancy;\\r\\nsuch a thorough observance of &quot;good form&quot; with so complete a freedom\\r\\nfrom priggishness and prudery. To this day there are lively\\r\\ncontroversies whether he worked up the Doone story from local tradition\\r\\nor made it &quot;out of his own head.&quot; But whichever he did (and the present\\r\\nhistorian owns that he cares very little about the point) the way in\\r\\nwhich he has turned a striking, but not extraordinary, and certainly not\\r\\nvery extensive West Country glen into an <i>Arabian Nights</i> valley, with\\r\\nthe figures and action of a medi&aelig;val romance <a name=\"Page_285\" id=\"Page_285\" />and the human interest of\\r\\na modern novel, is really wonderful. And there is hardly a book of his\\r\\nlast thirty years\\' production, from <i>Clara Vaughan</i> to <i>Perlycross</i>,\\r\\nwhich has not vigour, variety, character, &quot;race&quot; enough for half a\\r\\ndozen. In such books, for example, as <i>The Maid of Sker</i> and <i>Cripps the\\r\\nCarrier</i> the idiosyncrasy is extraordinary: the quaint and piquant\\r\\noddity of phrase and apophthegm is as vivid as Dickens, rather more\\r\\nreal, and tinged somehow with a flavour of literature, even of poetry,\\r\\nwhich was Dickens\\'s constant lack.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And yet when one comes to consider the books critically, either one by\\r\\none, or in pairs and batches, or as a whole, it is somehow or other\\r\\ndifficult to pronounce any one exactly a masterpiece. There is a want of\\r\\n&quot;inevitableness&quot; which sometimes amounts to improbability, as in the\\r\\ncase particularly of that most vivid and racy of books, <i>Cripps the\\r\\nCarrier</i>, where the central incident or situation, though by no means\\r\\nimpossible, is almost insultingly unlikely, and forces its unlikeliness\\r\\non one at almost every moment and turn. Never, perhaps, was there a\\r\\nbetter instance of that &quot;possible-improbable&quot; which contrasts so fatally\\r\\nwith the &quot;probable-impossible.&quot; In not a few cases, too, there is that\\r\\nreproduction of similar <i>d&eacute;nouements</i> and crucial occurrences which is\\r\\nalmost necessary in a time when men write many novels. In almost all\\r\\nthere is a want of central interest in the characters that should be\\r\\ncentral; in some an exaggeration of dialect; or of quaint non-dialectic\\r\\nbut also non-catholic locutions on the author\\'s part. One rather hates\\r\\noneself for finding such faults&mdash;no one of which is absolutely fatal&mdash;in\\r\\na mass of work which has given, and continues to give, so much pleasure:\\r\\nbut the facts remain. One would not have the books <i>not</i> written on any\\r\\naccount; but one feels that they were written <a name=\"Page_286\" id=\"Page_286\" />rather because the author\\r\\nchose to do so than because he could not help it. Now it is possible to\\r\\nexaggerate the necessity of &quot;mission&quot; and the like: but, after all, <i>Ich\\r\\nkann nicht anders</i> must be to some extent the mood of mind of the man\\r\\nwho is committing a masterpiece.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Something of the sort is still more noticeable in the work of other\\r\\nwriters of the period. We have seen that two ladies of great talent,\\r\\nMrs. Oliphant and Mrs. Craik, began to write, long before Mr. Meredith\\r\\npublished <i>Richard Feverel</i> and very little later than the time of\\r\\n<i>Vanity Fair</i>. They produced, the one in <i>Salem Chapel</i> (1863), a book\\r\\nwhich contemporaries might be excused for thinking likely to herald a\\r\\nnew George Eliot at least; the other, in <i>John Halifax, Gentleman</i>\\r\\n(1857), a book of more sentimentalism, but of great interest and merit.\\r\\nBoth were miracles of fecundity, Mrs. Craik producing, in the shorter\\r\\nlife of the two, not much fewer than fifty novels; Mrs. Oliphant,\\r\\nbesides a great deal of work in other departments, a tale which did not\\r\\nstop very far short of the hundred. The latter, moreover, gave, at a\\r\\ncomparatively late period of her career, evidences of being able to\\r\\nstart new lines&mdash;the supernatural stories of her last stages are only\\r\\ninferior to the <i>Chronicles of Carlingford</i> themselves. Yet, once more,\\r\\nwe look for a masterpiece in vain: in fact in Mrs. Oliphant\\'s case we\\r\\nask, how could any human being, on such a system of production, be\\r\\nexpected to produce masterpieces? Scott, I think, once wrote four or\\r\\nnearly four novels in a year: and the process helped to kill him. Mrs.\\r\\nOliphant did it over and over again, besides alternating the annual dose\\r\\nstill more frequently with twos and threes. In her case the process only\\r\\nkilled her novels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Three remarkable novelists of the other sex may be mentioned, in the\\r\\nsame way, together. They were all <a name=\"Page_287\" id=\"Page_287\" />acquaintances of the present writer,\\r\\nand one of them was his friend: moreover, he is quite certain that he\\r\\ncould not write as good a novel as the worst of theirs, and only takes\\r\\ncredit to himself for not having attempted to do so. These are James\\r\\nPayn, William Black, and Sir Walter Besant. Mr. Payn was an extremely\\r\\nagreeable person with a great talent for amusing, the measure of which\\r\\nhe perhaps took pretty early&mdash;consoling himself for a total absence of\\r\\nhigh pretension by a perhaps not quite genuine affectation of\\r\\ngood-natured but distinctly Philistine cynicism, and a half serious,\\r\\nhalf affected belief that other men\\'s delight in their schools, their\\r\\nuniversities, the great classics of the past, etc., was <i>blague</i>. He\\r\\nnever made this in the least offensive; he never made any one of his\\r\\nfifty or sixty novels anything but interesting and (when the subject\\r\\nrequired it) amusing. There never was any novelist less difficult to\\r\\nread a first time: I really do not know that it would be extremely\\r\\ndifficult to read him a second; but also I have seldom come across a\\r\\nnovelist with whom I was so little inclined to try it. It is a great\\r\\nthing, no doubt, as has been said, from a certain point of view&mdash;that of\\r\\n<i>pastime</i>&mdash;that the reading of a novel should be easy and pleasant. But\\r\\nperhaps this is not all that you are entitled to ask of it. And as Mr.\\r\\nPayn began with <i>Poems</i>, and some other suggestive books, I am inclined\\r\\nto think that perhaps he did <i>not</i> always regard literature as a thing\\r\\nof the kind of a superior railway sandwich.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is quite certain that, in his beginning, Mr. William Black\\r\\nentertained no such idea; for his actual <i>d&eacute;buts</i> were something like\\r\\nwhat long afterwards were called problem-novels, and <i>In Silk Attire</i>\\r\\n(1869), <i>Kilmeny</i> (1870), and the charming <i>Daughter of Heth</i> (1871)\\r\\nattempted a great deal besides mere amusement. It is true that no one of\\r\\nthem&mdash;not <a name=\"Page_288\" id=\"Page_288\" />even the last&mdash;could be called an entire success: a &quot;little\\r\\nmore powder&quot; was wanted to send the shots home, and such flight as they\\r\\nachieved did not even seem to be aimed at any distinct and worthy\\r\\nobject. But fortunately for his pocket, unfortunately for his fame, he\\r\\nhit the public taste of the time with a sort of guidebook-novel in <i>The\\r\\nStrange Adventures of a Phaeton</i> (1872) and <i>A Princess of Thule</i>\\r\\n(1873), and was naturally tempted to continue it, or to branch off only\\r\\ninto not very strong stories of society. Once he made an effort at\\r\\ncombining tragic romance with this latter kind in <i>Macleod of Dare</i>\\r\\n(1878), but, though this was nearer to a success than some of his\\r\\ncritics admitted, it was not quite a success: and though he wrote fully\\r\\na score of novels after it, he never came nearer the actual bull\\'s eye.\\r\\nIn fact his later work was not up to a very good average.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Neither of these writers, except, as has been said, perhaps Black in his\\r\\nearliest stage, had taken novel-writing very seriously: it was otherwise\\r\\nwith the third of the trio. Mr., afterwards Sir Walter, Besant did not\\r\\nbegin early, owing to the fact that, for nearly a decade after leaving\\r\\nCambridge, he was a schoolmaster in Mauritius. But he had, in this time,\\r\\nacquired a greater knowledge of literature than either of the other two\\r\\npossessed: and when he came home, and took to fiction, he accompanied it\\r\\nwith, or rather based it upon, not merely wide historical studies, which\\r\\nare still bearing fruit in a series of posthumous dealings with the\\r\\nhistory of London, but rather minute observation of the lower social\\r\\nlife of the metropolis. For some ten years his novel production was\\r\\ncarried on, in a rather incomprehensible system of collaboration, with\\r\\nJames Rice, a Cambridge man like himself and a historian of the turf,\\r\\nbut one to whom no independent work in fiction is attri<a name=\"Page_289\" id=\"Page_289\" />buted, except an\\r\\nincredibly feeble adaptation of <i>Mr. Verdant Green</i>, entitled <i>The\\r\\nCambridge Freshman</i> and signed &quot;Martin Legrand.&quot; During the seventies,\\r\\nand for a year or two later, till Rice\\'s death in 1882, the pair\\r\\nprovided along series of novels from <i>Ready-Money Mortiboy</i> (1871) to\\r\\n<i>The Chaplain of the Fleet</i> (1881), the most popular book between being,\\r\\nperhaps, <i>The Golden Butterfly</i> (1876). These belonged, loosely, to the\\r\\nschool of Dickens, as that school had been carried on by Wilkie Collins\\r\\n(<i>v. inf.</i>), but with less grotesque than the original master, and less\\r\\n&quot;sensation&quot; than the head pupil; with a good deal of solid knowledge\\r\\nboth of older and more modern life; with fairly substantial plots, good\\r\\ncharacter-drawing of the more external kind, and a sufficient supply of\\r\\ninteresting incident, dialogue, and description.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It was certain that people would affect to discover a &quot;falling off&quot; when\\r\\nthe partnership was dissolved by Rice\\'s death: but as a matter of fact\\r\\nthere was nothing of the kind. Such books as the very good and original\\r\\n<i>Revolt of Man</i> (which certainly owed nothing to collaboration), as <i>All\\r\\nSorts and Conditions of Men</i> (1882), the first of the kind apparently\\r\\nthat Besant wrote alone, as <i>Dorothy Forster</i> (1884), and as the\\r\\npowerful if not exactly delightful <i>Children of Gibeon</i> (1886) were\\r\\nperhaps more vigorous than anything earlier, and certainly not less\\r\\noriginal. But the curse of the &quot;machine-made&quot; novel, which has been\\r\\nalready dwelt upon, did not quite spare Besant: and in these later\\r\\nstories critics could point, without complete unfairness, to an\\r\\nincreasing obsession of the &quot;London&quot; subject, especially in regard to\\r\\nthe actual gloom and possible illumination of the East End, and on the\\r\\nother to a resort to historical subjects, less as suggestions or\\r\\ncanvases than as giving the substance of the book.<a name=\"Page_290\" id=\"Page_290\" /> The first class of\\r\\nwork, however (which actually resulted in a &quot;People\\'s Palace&quot; and was\\r\\nsupposed to have obtained his knighthood for him), is distinctly\\r\\nremarkable, especially in the light of succeeding events. Most of the\\r\\nunfavourable criticisms passed upon Besant\\'s novel-work were in the main\\r\\nthe utterances of raw reviewers, who thought it necessary to &quot;down&quot;\\r\\nestablished reputations. But it would be impossible for any competent\\r\\ncritic, however much he might be biassed off the bench by friendship,\\r\\nnot to admit, on it, that he also shows the effect, which we have been\\r\\nillustrating from others, of the system of novel-production <i>&agrave; la\\r\\ndouzaine</i>. In such a case, and on the, in themselves, salutary\\r\\nconditions of the new novel, the experiences and interests of life may\\r\\nor must come to be regarded too regularly as supplying &quot;grist for the\\r\\nmill&quot;; nay, the whole of life and literature, which no doubt ought in\\r\\nall cases to furnish suggestion and help to art and inspiration, are too\\r\\noften set to a sort of <i>corv&egrave;e</i>, a day-task, a tale of bricks. It is,\\r\\none allows, hard to prevent this: and yet nothing is more certain that\\r\\nbricks so made are not the best material to be wrought into any really\\r\\n&quot;star-y-pointing pyramid&quot; that shall defy the operations of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A very curious and characteristic member of this group, Wilkie Collins,\\r\\nhas not yet been mentioned except by glances. He was a little older than\\r\\nmost of them, and came pretty early under the influence of Dickens,\\r\\nwhose melodramatic rather than his humorous side he set himself to work\\r\\nto develop. In fact Collins was at least as much melodramatist as\\r\\nnovelist: and while most of his novels are melodrama in narrative form,\\r\\nnot a few of them were actually dramatised. He began as early as\\r\\n1850&mdash;the dividing year&mdash;with <i>Antonina</i>: but his three great triumphs\\r\\nin the &quot;sensation&quot; novel (as it was rather stupidly called)<a name=\"Page_291\" id=\"Page_291\" /> were <i>The\\r\\nDead Secret</i> (1857), <i>The Woman in White</i> (1860), and <i>No Name</i> (1862).\\r\\nThroughout the sixties and a little later, in <i>Armadale</i> (1866), <i>The\\r\\nMoonstone</i> (1870), perhaps <i>The New Magdalen</i> (1873), and even as late\\r\\nas 1875 in <i>The Law and the Lady</i>, his work continued to be eagerly\\r\\nread. But the taste for it waned: and its author\\'s last fifteen years or\\r\\nso (he died in 1889), though fairly fruitful in quantity, certainly did\\r\\nnot tend to keep it up in quality. Although Collins had a considerable\\r\\namount of rather coarse vigour in him (his brother Charles, who died\\r\\nyoung, had a much more delicate art) and great fecundity in a certain\\r\\nkind of stagy invention, it is hard to believe that his work will ever\\r\\nbe put permanently high. It has a certain resemblance in method to\\r\\nGodwin and Mrs. Radcliffe, exciting situations being arranged, certainly\\r\\nwith great cleverness, in an interminable sequence, and leading,\\r\\nsometimes at any rate, to a violent &quot;revolution&quot; (in the old dramatic\\r\\nsense) at the end. Perhaps the best example is the way in which Magdalen\\r\\nVanstone\\'s desperate and unscrupulous, though more than half\\r\\njustifiable, machinations, to reverse the cruel legal accident which\\r\\nleaves her and her sister with &quot;No Name&quot; and no fortune, are foiled by\\r\\nthe course of events, though the family property is actually recovered\\r\\nfor this sister who has been equally guiltless and inactive. Of its\\r\\nkind, the machinery is as cleverly built and worked as that of any novel\\r\\nin the world: but while the author has given us some Dickensish\\r\\ncharacter-parts of no little attraction (such as the agreeable rascal\\r\\nCaptain Wragge) and has nearly made us sympathise strongly with Magdalen\\r\\nherself, he only succeeds in this latter point so far as to make us\\r\\nangry with him for his prudish poetical or theatrical justice, which is\\r\\nnot poetical and hardly even just.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_292\" id=\"Page_292\" />The specialist or particularist novel was not likely to be without\\r\\npractitioners during this time: in fact it might be said, after a\\r\\nfashion, to be more rife than ever: but it can only be glanced at here.\\r\\nIts most remarkable representatives perhaps&mdash;men, however, of very\\r\\ndifferent tastes and abilities&mdash;were Richard Jefferies and Joseph Henry\\r\\nShorthouse. The latter, after attracting very wide attraction by a\\r\\nremarkable book&mdash;almost a kind to itself&mdash;<i>John Inglesant</i> (1880), a\\r\\nhalf historical, half ecclesiastical novel of seventeenth-century life,\\r\\nnever did anything else that was any good at all, and indeed tried\\r\\nlittle. The former, a struggling country journalist, after long failing\\r\\nto make any way, wrote several three-volume novels of no merit, broke\\r\\nthrough at last in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> with a series of studies of\\r\\ncountry life, <i>The Gatekeeper at Home</i> (1878), and afterwards turned\\r\\nthese into a peculiar style of novel, with little story and hardly any\\r\\ncharacter, but furnished with the backgrounds and the atmosphere of\\r\\nthese same sketches. His health was weak, and he died in early middle\\r\\nage, leaving a problem of a character exactly opposed to the other.\\r\\nWould Mr. Shorthouse, if he had not been a well-to-do man of business,\\r\\nbut obliged to write for his living, have done more and better work?\\r\\nWould Jefferies, if he had been more fortunate in education, occupation,\\r\\nand means, and furnished with better health, have co-ordinated and\\r\\nexpanded his certainly rare powers into something more &quot;important&quot; than\\r\\nthe few pictures, as of a Meissonier-<i>paysagiste</i>, which he has left us?\\r\\nThese inquiries are no doubt idle: but, once more, one may draw\\r\\nattention to the way in which two men, so different in tastes and\\r\\nfortune, neither, it would seem, with a very strong bent towards prose\\r\\nfiction as the vehicle of his literary desires and accomplishments,\\r\\nappear to have <a name=\"Page_293\" id=\"Page_293\" />been forced, by the overpowering attraction and\\r\\npopularity of the kind, to adopt the novel as their form of literature,\\r\\nand to give the public, not what they wanted in the form which they\\r\\nchose, but something at least made up in the form that the public\\r\\nwanted, and disguised in the wrappers which the public were accustomed\\r\\nto purchase.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The principal development of mid-nineteenth-century fiction had been, as\\r\\nwe have seen, in the direction of the novel <i>proper</i>&mdash;the\\r\\ncharacter-study of modern ordinary life. But, even as early as <i>Esmond</i>\\r\\nand <i>Hypatia</i>, signs were not wanting that the romance, historical or\\r\\nother, was not going to be content with the rather pale copies of Scott,\\r\\nand the rococo-sentimental style of Bulwer, which had mainly occupied it\\r\\nfor the last quarter of a century. Still, though we have mentioned other\\r\\nexamples of the fifties and sixties, and have left ever so many more\\r\\nunmentioned, it was certainly not as popular<a id=\"footnotetag27\" name=\"footnotetag27\"></a><a href=\"#footnote27\"><sup>27</sup></a> as its rival till,\\r\\ntowards the end of the latter decade, Mr. Blackmore\\'s <i>Lorna Doone</i> gave\\r\\nit a fresh hold on the public taste. Some ten years later again there\\r\\ncame to its aid a new recruit of very exceptional character, Mr. Robert\\r\\nLouis Stevenson. He was a member of the famous family of light-house\\r\\nengineers, and was educated for the Bar of Scotland, to which he was\\r\\nactually called. But law was as little to his taste as engineering, and\\r\\nhe slowly gravitated towards literature&mdash;the slowness being due, not\\r\\nmerely to family opposition or to any other of the usual causes (though\\r\\nsome of these were at work), but to an intense and elaborate desire to\\r\\nwork himself out a style of his own by the process of &quot;sedulously aping&quot;\\r\\nothers. It may be<a name=\"Page_294\" id=\"Page_294\" /> very much doubted whether this process ever gave any\\r\\none a style of perfect freedom: and it may be questioned further whether\\r\\nStevenson ever attained such a style.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But there could be no question that he did attain very interesting and\\r\\nartistic effects, and there happened to be at the time a reaction\\r\\nagainst what was called &quot;slovenliness&quot; and a demand for careful\\r\\npreparation and planned effect in prose-writing. Even so, however, it\\r\\nwas not at once that Stevenson took to fiction. He began with essays,\\r\\nliterary and miscellaneous, and with personal accounts of travel: and\\r\\ncertain critical friends of his strongly urged him to continue in this\\r\\nway. During the years 1878 and 1879, in a short-lived periodical called\\r\\n<i>London</i>, which came to be edited by his friend the late Mr. Henley and\\r\\nhad a very small staff, he issued certain <i>New Arabian Nights</i> which\\r\\ncaught the attention of one or two of his fellow-contributors very\\r\\nstrongly, and made them certain that a new power in fiction-writing had\\r\\narisen. It did not, however, at first much attract the public: and it\\r\\nwas the kind of thing which never attracts publishers until the public\\r\\nforces their hands. For a time he had to wait, and to take what\\r\\nopportunity he could get of periodical publication, &quot;boy\\'s\\r\\nbook&quot;-writing, and the like. In fact <i>Treasure Island</i> (1883), with\\r\\nwhich he at last made his mark, is to this day classed as a boy\\'s book\\r\\nby some people who are miserable if they cannot classify. It certainly\\r\\ndeals with pirates, and pieces of eight, and adventures by land and sea;\\r\\nbut the manner of dealing&mdash;the style and narrative and the delineation\\r\\nof the chief character, the engaging villain John Silver&mdash;is about as\\r\\nlittle puerile as anything that can be imagined. From that time\\r\\nStevenson\\'s reputation was assured. Ill health, a somewhat restless\\r\\ndisposition, and an early death pre<a name=\"Page_295\" id=\"Page_295\" />vented him from accomplishing any\\r\\ngreat bulk of work: and the merit of what he did varied. Latterly he\\r\\ntook to a teasing process of collaboration, which his sincerest admirers\\r\\ncould have willingly spared. But his last completed book, <i>Catriona</i>\\r\\n(1893), seemed to some judges of at least considerable experience the\\r\\nbest thing he had yet done, especially in one all-important\\r\\nrespect&mdash;that he here conquered either an unwillingness to attempt or an\\r\\ninability to achieve the portraiture of feminine character, which his\\r\\nbooks had previously displayed. The general opinion, too, was that the\\r\\nunfinished <i>Weir of Hermiston</i> (1897), which he left a fragment at his\\r\\ndeath, was the best and strongest thing he had done, while it showed in\\r\\nparticular a distinct relinquishment, for something freer and more\\r\\nspontaneous, of the effective but also rather affected and decidedly\\r\\nlaboured style in which he had hitherto written. For us, however, his\\r\\nstyle is of less importance than the fact that he applied it almost\\r\\nwholly to the carrying out of that rejuvenescence of romance of which we\\r\\nhave been speaking, and which may be taken, as anybody pleases, either\\r\\nfor a mere alternative to the domestic novel or as a definite revolt\\r\\nagainst it. It was speedily taken up by writers mostly still living, and\\r\\nso not to be dwelt on now.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Very late in the century the genius of Mr. William Morris turned from\\r\\nverse to prose tale-telling in a series of romances which caught the\\r\\nfancy neither of the public nor of the critics as a whole, but which\\r\\nseem to some whom the gods have made not quite uncritical to be, if\\r\\nrightly taken, of much accomplishment, and of almost more promise and\\r\\nsuggestion. These, seven or eight in number, from <i>The House of the\\r\\nWulfings</i> (1889) to <i>The Sundering Flood</i>, published after the author\\'s\\r\\ndeath in 1898, were actual romances&mdash;written in a kind of modernised\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_296\" id=\"Page_296\" />fifteenth-century English, and dealing, some with far back incidents of\\r\\nthe conflict between Romans and &quot;Barbarians,&quot; most with the frank\\r\\nno-time and no-place of Romance itself. They came at an unfortunate\\r\\nmoment, when the younger generation of readers were thinking it proper\\r\\nto be besotted with crude realism or story-less impressionism, and when\\r\\nsome at least of those who might have welcomed them earlier had left\\r\\ntheir first faith in poetry or poetic prose. There was, moreover,\\r\\nperhaps some genuine dislike, and certainly a good deal of precisian\\r\\ncondemnation, of the &quot;Wardour Street&quot; dialect. Yet there was no sham in\\r\\nthem: it was impossible for Mr. Morris to have anything to do with\\r\\nshams&mdash;even his socialism was not that&mdash;and they were in reality a\\r\\nrevival, however Rip van Winklish it might seem, of the pure old romance\\r\\nitself, at the hands of a nineteenth-century sorcerer, who no doubt put\\r\\na little of the nineteenth century into them. The best&mdash;probably the\\r\\nbest of all is <i>The Well at the World\\'s End</i> (1896)&mdash;have an\\r\\nextraordinary charm for any one who can taste romance: and are by no\\r\\nmeans unlikely to awake the taste for it in generations to come. But for\\r\\nthe present the thing lay out of the way of its generation, and was not\\r\\ncomprehended or enjoyed thereby. For it is no doubt nearly as annoying\\r\\nto have bread given to you when you want thistles as to have thistles\\r\\ngiven to you when you want bread. But just as the ballad is the\\r\\nappointed reviver of poetry, so is romance the appointed reviver of\\r\\nprose-fiction: and in one form or another it will surely do its work,\\r\\nsooner or later.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Here it may be best to stop the actual current of critical comment on\\r\\nindividuals. Something has been hinted as to the general present\\r\\ncondition of the novel, but there is no need to emphasise it or to enter\\r\\ninto particulars about it:<a name=\"Page_297\" id=\"Page_297\" /> indeed, even if such a proceeding were\\r\\nconvenient in one way it would be very inconvenient in another. One\\r\\nmight, for instance, have to consider, rather curiously, a remarkable\\r\\nstatement recently attributed to a popular novelist that &quot;the general\\r\\nstandard of excellence in fiction is higher <i>to-day</i> than ever it was\\r\\nbefore.&quot; But we can take higher ground. Far be it from me to bow to the\\r\\nBaal of &quot;up-to-dateness,&quot; for even if I had any such hankering, I think\\r\\nI should remember that the surest way of being out-of-date to-morrow is\\r\\nthe endeavour to be up-to-date to-day. Only by keeping perspective can\\r\\nyou hope to confirm and steady your view: only by relinquishing the\\r\\nimpossible attempt to be complete can you achieve a relative\\r\\ncompleteness.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet it is well to remember that Lockhart, one of the best critics who\\r\\never lived (when he let himself be so), a novelist too, and not likely\\r\\nto lose an opportunity of magnifying his office if he could, took\\r\\noccasion, in noticing the novels of his friend Theodore Hook at poor\\r\\n&quot;Mr. Wagg\\'s&quot; death, gravely to deplore the decadence of the novel\\r\\ngenerally: and not much later, in reprinting the article, had the wisdom\\r\\nto recognise, and the courage to record, the fact that Thackeray had\\r\\ndisappointed his prognostications. Literature, it has been said, is the\\r\\nincalculable of incalculables: and not only may a new novelist arise\\r\\nto-morrow, but some novelist who has been writing for almost any number\\r\\nof years may change his style, strike the vein, and begin the\\r\\nexploitation of a new gold-field in novel-production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But this does not affect the retrospect of the past. There we are on\\r\\nperfectly firm ground&mdash;ground which we have traversed carefully already,\\r\\nand which we may survey in surety now.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a name=\"Page_298\" id=\"Page_298\" />We have seen, then, that the prose novel&mdash;a late growth both in ancient\\r\\nand in modern times in all countries&mdash;was a specially late and\\r\\nslow-yielding one in English. Although Thoms\\'s <i>Early English Prose\\r\\nRomances</i> is by no means an exhaustive collection, and for this reason\\r\\nwas not specially referred to in the first chapter, it is impossible not\\r\\nto recognise that its three rather small volumes, of matter for the most\\r\\npart exceeding poor and beggarly, contrast in the most pitiful fashion\\r\\nwith the scores and almost hundreds containing Early English Romances in\\r\\nverse. Malory of course brings the prose-scale down very considerably\\r\\nfrom its uncomfortably <i>meteoric</i> position, and some other things help:\\r\\nbut the total of prose and verse before 1500 can be brought level by no\\r\\npossible sleight of weighing. Still, as we have seen, this did not\\r\\nmatter very much: for the verse got &quot;transprosed&quot; sooner or later, and\\r\\nthe romances and tales of other countries were greedily admitted <i>ad\\r\\neundem</i> in sixteenth and seventeenth century English.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet the novel proper lingered: and, except in the single and eccentric\\r\\nmasterpiece of Bunyan, the seventeenth century ended without having seen\\r\\none real specimen of prose fiction that was thoroughly satisfactory.\\r\\nNearly half the eighteenth had gone too, with nothing but the less\\r\\nisolated but still not perfect performances of Defoe, and the once more\\r\\nstill eccentric masterpiece of <i>Gulliver</i>, before the novel-period\\r\\nreally opened. It is literally not more than two long lifetimes ago&mdash;it\\r\\nis quite certain that there are now living hundreds, perhaps thousands,\\r\\nof persons born when others were still living who drew their first\\r\\nbreaths in or before the year when Pamela made her modest, but very\\r\\ndistinctly self-conscious, curtsey to the world. How soon it grew to a\\r\\npopular form of literature, <a name=\"Page_299\" id=\"Page_299\" />and how steadily that popularity has\\r\\ncontinued and increased, there is not much need to say or to repeat.\\r\\nStatistical persons every year give us the hundreds of novels that\\r\\nappear from the presses, and the thousands of readers who take them out\\r\\nof, or read them in, public libraries. I do not know whether there\\r\\nexists anywhere a record of the total number published since 1740, but I\\r\\ndare say it does. I should not at all wonder if this total ran into\\r\\nscores of thousands: if you were to bring in short stories it would\\r\\ncertainly do so. People have almost left off shaking their heads over\\r\\nthe preponderant or exclusive attention to fiction in these public\\r\\nlibraries themselves: in fact the tendency seems to be rather to make\\r\\nout that it is decreasing. It may be so; or it may not. But what remains\\r\\ncertain is that there is a very large number of educated people to whom\\r\\n&quot;reading&quot; simply means reading novels; who never think of taking up a\\r\\nbook that is not a novel; for whom the novel exhausts even the very\\r\\nmeaning of the word &quot;literature.&quot; We know that the romance was\\r\\noriginally so called simply because it was the commonest book in\\r\\n&quot;Romance&quot; language. We are less unsophisticated now: but there are\\r\\ncertainly large numbers of His Majesty\\'s subjects by whom a novel on\\r\\nthis principle ought to be called &quot;an english&quot; though it might have to\\r\\nshare that appellation with the newspaper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet, as we have seen, for this or that reason, the <i>average</i> novel did\\r\\nnot come to anything like perfection for a very long time. In a single\\r\\nexample, or set of examples, it reached something like perfection almost\\r\\nat once. Fielding, Scott, Miss Austen, and Thackeray are the Four\\r\\nMasters of the whole subject, giving the lady the same degree as the\\r\\nothers by courtesy of letters. But in the first (as for the matter of\\r\\nthat in the last) of the four the success was <a name=\"Page_300\" id=\"Page_300\" />rather a matter of\\r\\nindividual and inimitable genius than of systematic discovery of method\\r\\npracticable by others. Nobody, except Thackeray himself, has ever\\r\\nfollowed Fielding successfully, and that only in parts and touches; as\\r\\nFielding had (unfortunately) no opportunity of following Thackeray, no\\r\\none has ever followed Thackeray satisfactorily at all. Such reasons as\\r\\npresented themselves have been given for the fact that nearly half of\\r\\nthe whole period passed before the two systems&mdash;of the pure novel and\\r\\nthe novel-romance&mdash;were discovered: and even then they were not at once\\r\\nput to work. But the present writer would be the very first to confess\\r\\nthat these explanations leave a great deal unexplained.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet whatever faults there might be in the supply there could be no doubt\\r\\nabout the demand when it was once started. It was indeed almost entirely\\r\\nindependent of the goodness or badness of the average supply itself.\\r\\nAllowing for the smaller population and the much smaller proportion of\\r\\nthat population who were likely to&mdash;who indeed could&mdash;read, and for the\\r\\ninferior means of distribution, it may be doubted whether the largest\\r\\nsales of novels recorded in the last half century have surpassed those\\r\\nof the most trumpery trash of the &quot;Minerva Press&quot; period&mdash;the last\\r\\ndecade of the eighteenth and the first of the nineteenth century. For\\r\\nthe main novel-public is quite omnivorous, and almost absolutely\\r\\nuncritical of what it devours. The admirable though certainly fortunate\\r\\nScot who &quot;could never remember drinking bad whisky&quot; might be echoed, if\\r\\nthey had the wit, by not a few persons who never seem to read a bad\\r\\nnovel, or at least to be aware that they are reading one.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the same time, the failure of the quest for novel-recipes was\\r\\ncompensated by an absence of that working of those <a name=\"Page_301\" id=\"Page_301\" />recipes to death\\r\\nwhich the last century&mdash;or the last three-quarters of it&mdash;has seen. The\\r\\naverage work of any one of a dozen nineteenth-century producers of\\r\\nnovels by the dozen and the score, whom at this place it is not\\r\\nnecessary to name, is probably on the whole a much better turned out\\r\\nthing&mdash;one better observing its own purposes, and open to less criticism\\r\\nin detail&mdash;than even the best of the works of the earlier division\\r\\noutside of Fielding. But the eighteenth-century books&mdash;faulty, only\\r\\npartially satisfying as they may be in comparison, say, with a\\r\\nwell-succeeded Trollope or one of the better Blackmores&mdash;very often have\\r\\na certain idiosyncrasy, a freedom from machine-work, which supplies\\r\\nsomething not altogether unlike the contrast between the furniture of\\r\\nthe two periods. Stress and dwelling have been purposely given, to some\\r\\nminor books of this period, for this very reason.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But at the same time the limitations, outside the greatest, are\\r\\ncertainly peculiar. It seems wonderful that a man like Cumberland, for\\r\\ninstance, who had not a little literary talent, should not have been\\r\\nable to make <i>Henry</i> into a story of real interest that might hold the\\r\\nreader as even second-class Trollope&mdash;say a book like <i>Orley\\r\\nFarm</i>&mdash;does. We have ungraciously recognised that some of our lady\\r\\nnovelists, who wrote by forties and by fifties, did not always sustain\\r\\nthe interest of their novels. Miss Burney wrote four in all, and could\\r\\nhardly keep up the interest of hers right through the second. Above all,\\r\\nthere is the difficulty of their failure with conversation and, in fact,\\r\\nwith any diction proper for conversation. If Horace Walpole, a\\r\\ncontemporary of the eighteenth-century novel from its actual start to\\r\\npractically its finish, could give us thousands and all but tens of\\r\\nthousands of phrases that want but a little of being novel-conversation\\r\\nready made, <a name=\"Page_302\" id=\"Page_302\" />why could not the other people make it for their own\\r\\npurposes? But we have got no answer to these questions: and probably\\r\\nthere is none.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The way in which Scott and Miss Austen themselves simultaneously found\\r\\nout the secrets of the two kinds of novel is no doubt, as such ways\\r\\nalways are, in the larger part mysterious: but to a certain extent it\\r\\ncan be explained and analysed, independently of the direct literary\\r\\ngenius of each. One of the greatest gifts of Scott&mdash;one with which the\\r\\nnon-historical novelist can dispense as little as his brother the\\r\\nhistorical&mdash;was that &quot;genius of history&quot; with which Lord Morley&mdash;a\\r\\ncritic not likely to be misled by sympathy in some respects at any\\r\\nrate&mdash;has justly credited him. For unless you have this &quot;historic\\r\\nsense,&quot; as it has been more generally and perhaps better termed (though\\r\\nto the intense disgust of some professed historians), it is not only\\r\\nimpossible for you to delineate scene and character at a distance from\\r\\nyour time, but you become really disqualified for depicting your own\\r\\ntime itself. You fail to distinguish the temporary from the permanent;\\r\\nyou achieve perhaps a fairly faithful copy of actual manners and\\r\\nfashions, but you do nothing more, and as the subject dies so does the\\r\\npicture. Contrast Hook, say, with Thackeray, and the difference will\\r\\nemerge at once.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Secondly, Scott had, besides this historic sense and the relish for\\r\\nhumanity which must accompany it, a knowledge of literature with which\\r\\nhe has been too seldom credited to the full. When he published\\r\\n<i>Waverley</i> he had been reading all sorts and conditions of books for\\r\\nsome five-and-thirty years, and assimilating them if, as the pedants\\r\\nwill have it, with a distressing inaccuracy in particulars, with a\\r\\ngeneral and genial fidelity of which the pedants do not even dream and\\r\\ncould not comprehend, or they would <a name=\"Page_303\" id=\"Page_303\" />not be pedants. He was thus\\r\\nfurnished with infinite stores of illustrative matter, never to\\r\\noverpower, but always to accompany and season, his knowledge of life. In\\r\\na few instances this felicity of adoption has been recognised, but not a\\r\\ntenth part of it has ever been systematically put on record. The more\\r\\nwidely and the longer a man reads, the more constantly will he find that\\r\\nScott has been before him, and has &quot;lifted&quot; just the touch that he\\r\\nwanted at the time and in the place.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But perhaps a greater gift (there were still others which it would be\\r\\nlong to perscribe&mdash;descriptive faculty, humour, pathos, half a dozen\\r\\nother things of the highest importance in themselves, but of less\\r\\nspecial application) was that which enabled him to discover and apply\\r\\nsomething like a universal novel <i>language</i>. He did this, not as\\r\\nShakespeare did (and as nobody but Shakespeare, except perhaps Dante to\\r\\nsome extent, ever has done or apparently could do), by making a really\\r\\nuniversal language which fits all times and persons because it is\\r\\nuniversal like its creator\\'s soul. Still less did he do it by adopting\\r\\nthe method which Spenser did consummately, but which almost everybody\\r\\nelse has justified Ben Jonson by doing very badly:&mdash;that is to say by\\r\\nconstructing a mosaic of his own. But his own method was nearer to this\\r\\nlatter. For historical creations (the most important of his\\r\\nnon-historic, <i>Guy Mannering</i> and the <i>Antiquary</i>, were so near his own\\r\\ntime that he had no difficulty) he threw back with remarkable cunning to\\r\\na period somewhat earlier, and coloured this up to the required tint by\\r\\nactual suggestions from contemporary, or nearly contemporary,\\r\\nliterature, where he could get it. He has done this so consummately that\\r\\nperhaps the only novel of his where the language strikes us as\\r\\nartificial is <a name=\"Page_304\" id=\"Page_304\" />the single one in which he actually endeavoured to be\\r\\n&quot;up-to-date&quot;&mdash;<i>St. Ronan\\'s Well</i>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This question of &quot;Lingo,&quot; on the other hand, was Miss Austen\\'s weakest\\r\\npoint: and we have seen and shall see that it continued to be a weak\\r\\npoint with others. Some admirers have defended her even here: but proud\\r\\nas I am to be an Austen Friar, a knight (or at least squire) of the\\r\\norder of St. Jane, I cannot go to this length. She very nearly\\r\\nsucceeded, and sometimes she did quite: but not always. The easy\\r\\ndialogue and phrase that we find as early as Horace Walpole, even as\\r\\nChesterfield and Lady Mary, in letters; which, in her own early days,\\r\\nappears in Fanny Burney\\'s diaries but not in the novels, does not seem\\r\\nalways within Miss Austen\\'s grasp. But her advance in this respect is\\r\\nenormous: she is, for instance, far beyond Scott himself in <i>St. Ronan\\'s\\r\\nWell</i>: and when she is thoroughly interested in a character, and engaged\\r\\nin unfolding it and gently satirising it at the same time, she rarely\\r\\ngoes even a hair\\'s-breadth wrong. In almost every other respect she does\\r\\nnot go wrong to the extent of the minutest section of a hair. The story\\r\\nis the least part with her: but her stories are always miraculously\\r\\n<i>adequate</i>: neither desultory and pillar-to-post, nor elaborated with\\r\\nthe minuteness which seems to please some people, but which is quite\\r\\nindifferent to the majority, and is certainly a positive nuisance to a\\r\\nfew who are not quite of negligible judgment. But the reason of this\\r\\nadequacy in story contains in itself her greatest triumph. Not being a\\r\\npoet, she cannot reach the Shakespearian consummateness of poetic\\r\\nphrase: though she sometimes comes not so far short of this in the prose\\r\\nvariety. But in the other great province of character, though hers is\\r\\nbut a Rutland to his Yorkshire&mdash;or rather to his England or his\\r\\nworld&mdash;she is almost equally supreme. And by her manipu<a name=\"Page_305\" id=\"Page_305\" />lation of it she\\r\\nshowed, once for all, how the most ordinary set of circumstances, and\\r\\neven the most ordinary characters in a certain sense, can be made to\\r\\nsupply the material of prose fiction to an absolutely illimitable\\r\\nextent. Her philosopher\\'s stone (to take up the old parable again) does\\r\\nnot lose its powers even when all the metal in the house is\\r\\nexhausted&mdash;if indeed the metal, or anything else, in the House of\\r\\nHumanity were exhaustible. The chairs and tables, the beds and the\\r\\nbasins&mdash;everything&mdash;can be made into novel-gold: and, when it has been\\r\\nmade, it remains as useful for future conversion, by the same or any\\r\\nother magician of the same class, as ever. One of the most curious\\r\\nthings about Miss Austen is the entire absence of self-repetition in\\r\\nher. Even her young men&mdash;certainly not her greatest successes&mdash;are by no\\r\\nmeans doubles of each other: and nature herself could not turn out half\\r\\na dozen girls more subtly and yet more sufficiently differentiated than\\r\\nCatherine and Elizabeth, Marianne and Fanny, Elinor and Emma, and\\r\\nfinally the three sisters of <i>Persuasion</i>, the other (quite other)\\r\\nElizabeth, Mary, and Anne. The &quot;ruts of the brain&quot; in novelists are a\\r\\nby-word. There are none here.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In these two great writers of English novel there is, really for the\\r\\nfirst time, the complementary antithesis after which people have often\\r\\ngone (I fear it must be said) wool-gathering elsewhere. The amateurs of\\r\\ncosmopolitan literature, I believe, like to find it in Stendhal and\\r\\nMichelet. They praise the former for his delicate and pitiless\\r\\npsychological analysis. It had been anticipated a dozen years, nay,\\r\\nnearly twenty years, before he saw the Beresina: and was being given out\\r\\nin print at about the very moment of that uncomfortable experience, and\\r\\nbefore he himself published anything, by a young English lady&mdash;a lady if\\r\\n<a name=\"Page_306\" id=\"Page_306\" />ever there was one and English if any person ever was&mdash;in a country\\r\\nparsonage in Hampshire or in hired houses, quite humdrum and commonplace\\r\\nto the commonplace and humdrum imagination, at Bath and Southampton.\\r\\nThey praise Michelet for his enthusiastic and multiform apprehension of\\r\\nthe plastic reality of the past, his re-creation of it, his putting of\\r\\nit, live and active, before the present. The thing had been done, twenty\\r\\nyears earlier again, by a Scotch advocate who had deliberately turned\\r\\nfrom poetic form, though he retained poetic imagination, and who did not\\r\\ndisdain not to make a fool of himself, as Michelet, with all his genius,\\r\\ndid again and again. Of all the essentials of the two manners of\\r\\nfictitious creation&mdash;Michelet\\'s was not fictitious, but he almost made\\r\\nit so, and Stendhal\\'s was not historical, but he almost made it so\\r\\nlikewise&mdash;Scott and Miss Austen had set the types, given the methods,\\r\\narranged the processes as definitely as Fust, or Coster, or Gutenberg,\\r\\nor Fust\\'s friend Mephistopheles&mdash;who perhaps, on the whole, has the best\\r\\ntitle to the invention&mdash;did in another matter three hundred years\\r\\nbefore.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That Scott\\'s variety should be taken up first, and should for a time\\r\\nhave the great popularity, the greater number of disciples, the greater\\r\\nacceptance as a mode of pleasing&mdash;was, as has been pointed out, natural\\r\\nenough; it is not a little significant that (to avert our eyes from\\r\\nEngland) the next practitioner of the psychological style in European\\r\\nliterature, Balzac, went through a long and mostly unsuccessful\\r\\nprobation in the other kind, and never wholly deserted it, or at least\\r\\nalways kept looking back to it. But the general shortcomings (as they\\r\\nhave been admitted to be) in the whole of the second quarter of the\\r\\ncentury (or a little less) with us, were but natural results of the\\r\\ninevitable <a name=\"Page_307\" id=\"Page_307\" />expatiation, unsystematic and irresolute, over the newly\\r\\ndiscovered provinces. And they gave admirable work of various\\r\\nkinds&mdash;work especially admirable if we remember that there was no\\r\\ngeneral literary uprising with us as there was, in France and elsewhere,\\r\\nabout 1830. If it were in any way possible&mdash;similar supposings have been\\r\\nadmitted in literature very often&mdash;it would be extremely interesting to\\r\\ntake a person <i>ex hypothesi</i> fairly acquainted with the rest of\\r\\nliterature&mdash;English, foreign, European, and classical&mdash;but who knew\\r\\nnothing and had heard nothing of Bulwer, Disraeli, Peacock, Marryat,\\r\\neven Ainsworth and James and others between Scott and the accomplished\\r\\nwork of Thackeray (Dickens\\'s is, as has been said, mainly a sport of\\r\\ngenius), and to turn him loose on this work. I do him the justice to\\r\\nsuppose that he would find not a few faults: I shall also do him the\\r\\njustice to think it likely that he (being, as said, <i>ex hypothesi</i>\\r\\nfurnished with the miscellaneous knowledge necessary to enjoy them)\\r\\nwould enjoy them very keenly and thoroughly. If you added the minorities\\r\\nof the time, such as that very clever Miss Robinson (I think her name\\r\\nwas Emma) who wrote <i>Whitefriars</i> and other historical romances in the\\r\\nforties; such as Charles Macfarlane, who died, like Colonel Newcome, a\\r\\npoor brother of the Charterhouse after writing capital things like <i>The\\r\\nDutch in the Medway</i> and <i>The Camp of Refuge</i>&mdash;if, I say, you gave him\\r\\nthese things and he was a good man, but lazy, like Gray, I think he\\r\\nwould vote for a continuance of his life of novels and sofas without\\r\\nsighing for anything further. But undoubtedly it might be contended that\\r\\nsomething further was needed: and it came. This was verisimilitude&mdash;the\\r\\nholding of the true mirror to actual society.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This verisimilitude, it should be observed, is not only <a name=\"Page_308\" id=\"Page_308\" />difficult to\\r\\nattain: it seems not to be easy even to recognise. I have seen it said\\r\\nthat the reason which makes it &quot;hopeless for many people even to try to\\r\\nget through <i>Pickwick</i>&quot; (their state itself must be &quot;hopeless&quot; enough,\\r\\nand it is to be hoped there are not &quot;many&quot; of them) is that it\\r\\n&quot;describes states of society unimaginable to many people of to-day.&quot;\\r\\nAgain, these many people must be somewhat unimaginative. But that is not\\r\\nthe point of the matter. The point is that Dickens depicts no &quot;state of\\r\\nsociety&quot; that ever existed, except in the <i>Dickensium Sidus</i>. What he\\r\\ngives is full of intensely real touches which help to create its charm.\\r\\nBut it is difficult to say that there is even a single person in it who\\r\\nis real as a whole, in the sense of having possibly existed in this\\r\\nworld: and the larger whole of the book generally is pure fantasy&mdash;as\\r\\nmuch so as one of the author\\'s own favourite goblin-dream stories.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With Thackeray the case is exactly the opposite. It is a testimony no\\r\\ndoubt to Dickens\\'s real power&mdash;though perhaps not to his readers\\'\\r\\nperspicacity&mdash;that he made them believe that he intended a &quot;state of\\r\\nsociety&quot; when, whether he intended it or not, he certainly has not given\\r\\nit. But Thackeray intended it and gave it. His is a &quot;state of society&quot;\\r\\nalways&mdash;whether in late seventeenth century, early or late eighteenth,\\r\\nearly or middle nineteenth&mdash;which existed or might have existed; his\\r\\npersons are persons who lived or might have lived. And it is the\\r\\ndiscovery of this art of creation by him and its parallel diffusion\\r\\namong his contemporaries that I am endeavouring to make clear here.\\r\\nFielding, Scott to some extent, Miss Austen had had it. Dickens, till\\r\\n<i>Great Expectations</i> at least, never achieved and I believe never\\r\\nattempted it. Bulwer, having failed in it for twenty years, struck it at\\r\\nlast about this <a name=\"Page_309\" id=\"Page_309\" />time, and so did, even before him, Mrs. Marsh, and\\r\\nperhaps others, falteringly and incompletely. But as a general gift&mdash;a\\r\\ncharacteristic&mdash;it never distinguished novelists till after the middle\\r\\nof the century.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is, I think, impossible to find a better meeting and overlapping\\r\\nplace of the old and the new novel, than that very remarkable book\\r\\n<i>Emilia Wyndham</i>, which has been already more than once referred to. It\\r\\nwas written in 1845 and appeared next year&mdash;the year of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.\\r\\nBut the author was twenty years older than Thackeray, though she\\r\\nsurvived him by nearly a dozen; she had not begun early; and she was\\r\\nfifty-five when she wrote <i>Emilia</i>. The not unnatural consequence is\\r\\nthat there is a great deal of inconsistency in the general texture of\\r\\nthe book: and that any clever cub, in the \\'prentice stage of reviewing,\\r\\ncould make columns of fun out of it. The general theme is age-old, being\\r\\nnot different from the themes of most other novels in that respect. A\\r\\nhalf-idiotic spendthrift (he ends as very nearly an actual idiot) not\\r\\nmerely wastes his own property but practically embezzles that of his\\r\\nwife and daughter; the wife dies and the daughter is left alone with an\\r\\nextravagant establishment, a father practically <i>non compos</i>, not a\\r\\npenny in her pocket after she has paid his doctor, and a selfish\\r\\nbaronet-uncle who will do less than nothing to help her. She has loved\\r\\nhalf unconsciously, and been half consciously loved by, a soldier cousin\\r\\nor quasi-cousin: but he is in the Peninsular War. Absolutely no help\\r\\npresents itself but that of a Mr. Danby, a conveyancer, who, in some way\\r\\nnot very consonant with the usual etiquette of his profession, has been\\r\\nmixed up with her father\\'s affairs&mdash;a man middle-aged, apparently dry as\\r\\nhis own parchments, and quite unversed in society. He helps her clumsily\\r\\nbut lavishly: and her uncle forces her <a name=\"Page_310\" id=\"Page_310\" />to accept his hand as the only\\r\\nmeans of saving her father from jail first and an asylum afterwards. The\\r\\ninevitable disunion, brought about largely by Danby\\'s mother (an awful\\r\\nold middle-class harridan), follows; and the desk-and-head incident\\r\\nmentioned above is brought about by her seeing the (false) announcement\\r\\nof her old lover\\'s death in the paper. But she herself is consistently,\\r\\nperhaps excessively, but it is fair to say not ridiculously, angelic;\\r\\nDanby is a gentleman and a good fellow at heart; and of course, after\\r\\nhighly tragical possibilities, these good gifts triumph. The greatest\\r\\ndanger is threatened, and the actual happy ending brought about, by an\\r\\nauxiliary plot, in which the actors are the old lover (two old lovers\\r\\nindeed), his wife (a beautiful featherhead, who has been Emilia\\'s\\r\\nschool-fellow and dearest friend), and a wicked &quot;Duke of C.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even from this sketch the tolerably expert reader of novels may discover\\r\\nwhere the weak points are likely to lie; he will be a real expert if he\\r\\nanticipates the strong ones without knowing the book. As was formerly\\r\\nnoticed, the dialogue is ill supplied with diction. The date of the\\r\\nstory is 1809: and the author had for that period a fairly safe pattern\\r\\nin Miss Austen: but she does not use it at all, nor does she make the\\r\\nlingo frankly that of her own day. There are gross improbabilities&mdash;Mr.\\r\\nDanby, for instance (who is represented as wrapped up in his business,\\r\\nand exclusively occupied with the legal side of money matters and the\\r\\nmoney side of the law), actually discharges, or thinks he is\\r\\ndischarging, hundreds and thousands of Mr. Wyndham\\'s liabilities by\\r\\nhanding his own open cheques, not to the creditors, not to any one\\r\\nrepresenting them, but to a country attorney who has succeeded him in\\r\\nthe charge of the debts and affairs, and whom he knows to be a sharp\\r\\npractitioner and suspects to be a scoundrel. The inhuman <a name=\"Page_311\" id=\"Page_311\" />uncle and the\\r\\nlicentious duke are mere cardboard characters: and the featherheaded\\r\\nLisa talks and behaves like a mixture of the sprightly heroines of\\r\\nRichardson (for whom Lady Mary most righteously prescribed a sound\\r\\nwhipping) and the gushing heroines of Lady Morgan. There is too much\\r\\nchaise-and-four and laudanum-bottle; too much moralising; too much of a\\r\\ngood many other things. And yet, somehow or other, there are also things\\r\\nvery rarely to be found in any novel&mdash;even taking in Bulwer and the\\r\\nserious part of Dickens&mdash;up to the date. The scene between Danby and his\\r\\nmother, in the poky house in Charlotte Street, when she discovers that\\r\\nhe has been giving a hundred-pound cheque to a young lady is\\r\\nimpressingly good: it is not absolutely unsuggestive of what Thackeray\\r\\nwas just doing, and really not far from what Trollope was not for some\\r\\nyears to do. There are other passages which make one think of George\\r\\nEliot, who indeed might have been writing at the very time; there are\\r\\neven faint and faltering suggestions of Ibsenic &quot;duty to ourselves.&quot; Mr.\\r\\nDanby (the characters regularly call each other &quot;Mr.,&quot; &quot;Mrs.,&quot; and\\r\\n&quot;Miss,&quot; even when they are husbands and wives, daughters or nieces, and\\r\\nuncles or fathers) is a miss, and not quite a miss, of a very striking,\\r\\noriginal, possible, and even probable character. His mother, with\\r\\nsomething more of the Dickensian type-character, can stand by her\\r\\nunpleasant self, and came ten years before &quot;the Campaigner.&quot; Susan, her\\r\\npleasanter servant, is equally self-sufficing, and came five years\\r\\nbefore Peggotty, to whom she is not without resemblances.<a id=\"footnotetag28\" name=\"footnotetag28\"></a><a href=\"#footnote28\"><sup>28</sup></a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But it is not so much the merits on the one hand, or the defects on the\\r\\nother, of the book that deserve attention <a name=\"Page_312\" id=\"Page_312\" />here and justify the place\\r\\ngiven to it: it is the general &quot;chip-the-shell&quot; character. The shell is\\r\\nonly being chipped: large patches of it still hamper the chicken, which\\r\\nis thus a half developed and half disfigured little animal. All sorts of\\r\\ndidactics, of Byronic-Bulwerish sentiment, of conventionalities of\\r\\nvarious kinds, still hold their place; the language, as we have said, is\\r\\ntraditional and hardly even that; and the characters are partly drawn\\r\\nfrom Noah\\'s Arks of various dates, partly from the stock company of the\\r\\ntoy theatre. On the other hand, besides the touches of modernity already\\r\\nmentioned, and assisting them, there is a great attention to\\r\\n&quot;interiors.&quot; The writer has, for her time, a more than promising sense\\r\\nof the incongruity between Empire dress and furniture and the style of\\r\\nGeorge II.: and the shabbiness or actual squalor of Charlotte Street and\\r\\nChancery Lane show that she had either been a very early and forward\\r\\nscholar of Dickens, or had discovered the thing on her own account. Her\\r\\nage may excuse some of the weak points, but it makes the presence of the\\r\\nstrong ones all the more remarkable: and it shows all the more forcibly\\r\\nhow the general influences which were to produce the great central\\r\\ngrowth of Victorian novel were at work, and at work almost violently, in\\r\\nthe business of pulling down the old as well as of building up the new.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of that new novel it is not necessary to say much more. In the last\\r\\nfifty or sixty years of the nineteenth century it did, as it seems to\\r\\nme, very great things&mdash;so great that, putting poetry, which is supreme,\\r\\naside, there is no division of the world\\'s literature within a time at\\r\\nall comparable to its own which can much, if at all, excel it. It did\\r\\nthese great things because partly of the inscrutable laws which\\r\\ndetermined that a certain number of men and women of <a name=\"Page_313\" id=\"Page_313\" />unusual power\\r\\nshould exist, and should devote themselves to it, partly of the less\\r\\nheroic-sounding fact that the general appetite of other men and\\r\\nwomenkind could make it worth while for these persons of genius and\\r\\ntalent not to do something else. But even so, the examination, rightly\\r\\nconducted, discovers more than a sufficient dose of nobility. For the\\r\\nnovel appeal is not, after all, to a mere blind animal thirst for\\r\\nsomething that will pass and kill time, for something that will drug or\\r\\nflutter or amuse. Beyond and above these things there is something else.\\r\\nThe very central cause and essence of it&mdash;most definitely and most\\r\\nkeenly felt by nobler spirits and cultivated intelligences, but also\\r\\ndimly and unconsciously animating very ordinary people&mdash;is the human\\r\\ndelight in humanity&mdash;the pleasure of seeing the men and women of long\\r\\npast ages living, acting, and speaking as they might have done, those of\\r\\nthe present living, acting, speaking as they do&mdash;but in each case with\\r\\nthe portrayal not as a mere copy of particulars, but influenced with\\r\\nthat spirit of the universal which is the secret and the charm of art.\\r\\nIt is because the novels of these years recognised and provided this\\r\\npleasure in a greater degree than those of the former period (except the\\r\\nproductions of a few masters) that they deserve the higher position\\r\\nwhich has been here assigned them. If the novels of any period, before\\r\\nor since or to come, have deserved, may or shall deserve, a lower\\r\\nplace&mdash;it is, and will be, because of their comparative or positive\\r\\nneglect of the combination of these conditions. Perhaps it is not easy\\r\\nto see what new country there is for the novel to conquer. But, as with\\r\\nother kinds of literature, there is practically no limit to its powers\\r\\nof working its actual domains. In the finest of its already existing\\r\\nexamples it hardly yields in accomplishment even to poetry; in that\\r\\ngreat <a name=\"Page_314\" id=\"Page_314\" />secondary (if secondary) office of all Art&mdash;to redress the\\r\\napparent injustice, and console for the apparent unkindness, of\\r\\nNature&mdash;to serve as rest and refreshment between those exactions of life\\r\\nwhich, though neither unjust nor unkind, are burdensome, it has no equal\\r\\namong all the kinds of Art itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\" />\\r\\n<h2><a name=\"INDEX\" id=\"INDEX\" /><a name=\"Page_315\" id=\"Page_315\" />INDEX</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Adam Bede</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_249\\'>249</a> <br />\\r\\nAdams, W.,  <a href=\\'#Page_259\\'>259</a> <br />\\r\\nAddison,  <a href=\\'#Page_62\\'>62</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_63\\'>63</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_154\\'>154</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_253\\'>253</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Adeline Mowbray</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_173\\'>173</a> <br />\\r\\nAelfric,  <a href=\\'#Page_5\\'>5</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Agathos</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_259\\'>259</a> <br />\\r\\nAinsworth, H.,  <a href=\\'#Page_214\\'>214</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Alton Locke</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_245\\'>245</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_246\\'>246</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Amadis</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_30\\'>30</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_40\\'>40</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_41\\'>41</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_65\\'>65</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Amelia</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_110\\'>110</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_112\\'>112</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_118\\'>118</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_137\\'>137</a>  <i>n.</i><br />\\r\\n<i>Amis and Amillion</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_23\\'>23</a> <br />\\r\\nAmory, Thomas,  <a href=\\'#Page_140\\'>140</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_143\\'>143</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Anabasis, The</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_2\\'>2</a> <br />\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon, Romance in,  <a href=\\'#Page_4\\'>4</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_7\\'>7</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Anna</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_173\\'>173</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Anna St. Ives</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_167\\'>167</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Apollonius of Tyre</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_2\\'>2</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_5\\'>5</a> <br />\\r\\nApuleius,  <a href=\\'#Page_1\\'>1</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_3\\'>3</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_5\\'>5</a> <br />\\r\\nArblay, Madame d\\', <i>see</i> Burney, F.<br />\\r\\n<i>Arcadia, The</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_33\\'>33</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_36\\'>36</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_38\\'>38</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_66\\'>66</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Aretina</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_46\\'>46</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Arthour and Merlin</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_16\\'>16</a> <br />\\r\\nArthurian Legend, the, <a href=\"#CHAPTER_I\">chap. i.</a> <i>passim</i>;<br />\\r\\n<span style=\"margin-left: 1em;\">its romantic concentration,  <a href=\\'#Page_15\\'>15</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_17\\'>17</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_24\\'>24</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_31\\'>31</a> </span><br />\\r\\n<i>Ask Mamma</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_193\\'>193</a>  <i>n.</i><br />\\r\\n<i>Ass, The Golden</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_3\\'>3</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_5\\'>5</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Atlantis, The New</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_133\\'>133</a> <br />\\r\\nAusten, Miss,  <a href=\\'#Page_71\\'>71</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_110\\'>110</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_155\\'>155</a>, <a href=\"#CHAPTER_V\">chap. v.</a> <i>passim</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_230\\'>230</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_238\\'>238</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_253\\'>253</a>, <a href=\\'#Page_298\\'>298</a>  <i>sq.</i><br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<i>Badman, Mr</i>.,  <a href=\\'#Page_54\\'>54</a> <br />\\r\\nBage, R.,  <a href=\\'#Page_164\\'>164</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_166\\'>166</a> <br />\\r\\nBalzac,  <a href=\\'#Page_35\\'>35</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_122\\'>122</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_186\\'>186</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_278\\'>278</a>-<a href=\\'#Page_280\\'>280</a> <br />\\r\\nBanim,  <a href=\\'#Page_224\\'>224</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Barchester Towers</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_251\\'>251</a> <br />\\r\\nBarrett, E.S.,  <a href=\\'#Page_180\\'>180</a>,  <a href=\\'#Page_181\\'>181</a> <br />\\r\\n<i>Barry Lyndon</i>,  <a href=\\'#Page_231\\'>231</a> <br />\\r\\n&quot;Barsetshire Novels,&quot;

DENT & SONS LTD.\\nBEDFORD STREET, STRAND  1913\\nNEW YORK: E.P. BUTTON & CO.\\n\\nPREFACE\\nIt is somewhat curious that there is, so far as I know, no complete\\r\\nhandling in English of the subject of this volume, popular and important\\r\\nthough that subject has been. Dunlop\\'s History of Fiction, an\\r\\nexcellent book, dealt with a much wider matter, and perforce ceased its\\r\\ndealing just at the beginning of the most abundant and brilliant\\r\\ndevelopment of the English division. Sir Walter Raleigh\\'s English\\r\\nNovel, a book of the highest value for acute criticism and grace of\\r\\nstyle, stops short at Miss Austen, and only glances, by a sort of\\r\\nanticipation, at Scott. The late Mr. Sidney Lanier\\'s English Novel and\\r\\nthe Principle of its Development is really nothing but a laudatory\\r\\nstudy of \"George Eliot,\" with glances at other writers, including\\r\\nviolent denunciations of the great eighteenth-century men. There are\\r\\nnumerous monographs on parts of the subject: but nothing else that I\\r\\nknow even attempting the whole. I should, of course, have liked to deal\\r\\nwith so large a matter in a larger space: but one may and should\\r\\n\"cultivate the garden\" even if it is not a garden of many acres in\\r\\nextent. I need only add that I have endeavoured, not so much to give\\r\\n\"reviews\" of individual books and authors, as to indicate what Mr.\\r\\nLanier took for the second part of his title, but did not, I think,\\r\\nhandle very satisfactorily in his text.\\nI may perhaps add, without impropriety, that the composition of this\\r\\nbook has not been hurried, and that I have taken all the pains I could,\\r\\nby revision and addition as it proceeded, to make it a complete survey\\r\\nof the Novel, as it has come from the hands of all the more important\\r\\nnovelists, not now alive, up to the end of the nineteenth century.\\nGEORGE SAINTSBURY.\\nChristmas, 1912.\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n\\nI.

THE FICTION OF YESTERDAY—CONCLUSION\\nINDEX\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ENGLISH NOVEL\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\nTHE FOUNDATION IN ROMANCE\\nOne of the best known, and one of the least intelligible, facts of\\r\\nliterary history is the lateness, in Western European Literature at any\\r\\nrate, of prose fiction, and the comparative absence, in the two great\\r\\nclassical languages, of what we call by that name. It might be an\\r\\naccident, though a rather improbable one, that we have no Greek prose\\r\\nfiction till a time long subsequent to the Christian era, and nothing in\\r\\nLatin at all except the fragments of Petronius and the romance of\\r\\nApuleius. But it can be no accident, and it is a very momentous fact,\\r\\nthat, from the foundation of Greek criticism, \"Imitation,\" that is to\\r\\nsay \"Fiction\" (for it is neither more nor less), was regarded as not\\r\\nmerely the inseparable but the constituent property of poetry, even\\r\\nthough those who held this were doubtful whether poetry must necessarily\\r\\nbe in verse. It is another fact of the greatest importance that the\\r\\nancients who, in other forms than deliberate prose fiction, try to \"tell\\r\\na story,\" do not seem to know very well how to do it.\\nThe Odyssey is, indeed, one of the greatest of all stories, it is the\\r\\noriginal romance of the West; but the Iliad, though a magnificent\\r\\npoem, is not much of a story. Herodotus can tell one, if anybody can,\\r\\nand Plato (or Socrates) evidently could have done so if it had lain in\\r\\nhis way: while the Anabasis, though hardly the Cyropædia, shows\\r\\nglimmerings in Xenophon. But otherwise we must come down to Lucian and\\r\\nthe East before we find the faculty. So, too, in Latin before the two\\r\\nlate writers named above, Ovid is about the only person who is a real\\r\\nstory-teller. Virgil makes very little of his story in verse: and it\\r\\nis shocking to think how Livy throws away his chances in prose. No:\\r\\nputting the Petronian fragments aside, Lucian and Apuleius are the only\\r\\ntwo novelists in the classical languages before about 400 A.D.: and\\r\\nputting aside their odd coincidence of subject, it has to be remembered\\r\\nthat Lucian was a Syrian Greek and Apuleius an African Latin. The\\r\\nconquered world was to conquer not only its conqueror, but its\\r\\nconqueror\\'s teacher, in this youngest accomplishment of literary art.\\nIt was probably in all cases, if not certainly, mixed blood that\\r\\nproduced the curious development generally called Greek Romance. It is\\r\\nno part of our business to survey, in any detail, the not very numerous\\r\\nbut distinctly interesting compositions which range in point of\\r\\nauthorship from Longus and Heliodorus, probably at the meeting of the\\r\\nfourth and fifth centuries, to Eustathius in the twelfth. At one time\\r\\nindeed, when we may return to them a little, we shall find them\\r\\nexercising direct and powerful influence on modern European fiction, and\\r\\nso both directly and indirectly on English: but that is a time a good\\r\\nway removed from the actual beginning of our journey. Still, Apollonius\\r\\nof Tyre, which is probably the oldest piece of English prose fiction\\r\\nthat we have, is beyond all doubt derived ultimately from a Greek\\r\\noriginal of this very class: and the class itself is an immense advance,\\r\\nin the novel direction, upon anything that we have before. It is on the\\r\\none hand essentially a \"romance of adventure,\" and on the other\\r\\nessentially a \"love-story\"—in senses to which we find little in\\r\\nclassical literature to correspond in the one case and still less in the\\r\\nother. Instead of being, like Lucius and the Golden Ass, a tissue of\\r\\nstories essentially unconnected and little more than framed by the main\\r\\ntale, it is, though it may have a few episodes, an example of at least\\r\\nromantic unity throughout, with definite hero and definite heroine, the\\r\\nprominence and importance of the latter being specially noteworthy. It\\r\\nis in fact the first division of literature in which the heroine assumes\\r\\nthe position of a protagonist. If it falls short in character, so do\\r\\neven later romances to a great extent: if dialogue is not very\\r\\naccomplished, that also was hardly to be thoroughly developed till the\\r\\nnovel proper came into being. In the other two great divisions, incident\\r\\nand description, it is abundantly furnished. And, above all, the two\\r\\ngreat Romantic motives, Adventure and Love, are quite maturely present\\r\\nin it.\\nTo pass to the deluge, and beyond it, and to come to close quarters with\\r\\nour proper division, the origin of Romance itself is a very debatable\\r\\nsubject, or rather it is a subject which the wiser mind will hardly care\\r\\nto debate much. The opinion of the present writer—the result, at least,\\r\\nof many years\\' reading and thought—is that it is a result of the\\r\\nmarriage of the older East and the newer (non-classical) West through\\r\\nthe agency of the spread of Christianity and the growth and diffusion of\\r\\nthe \"Saint\\'s Life.\" The beginnings of Hagiology itself are very\\r\\nuncertain: but what is certain is that they are very early: and that as\\r\\nthe amalgamation or leavening of the Roman world with barbarian material\\r\\nproceeded, the spread of Christianity proceeded likewise. The Vision of\\r\\nSt. Paul—one of the earliest examples and the starter it would seem,\\r\\nif not of the whole class of sacred Romances, at any rate of the large\\r\\nsubsection devoted to Things after Death—has been put as early as\\r\\n\"before 400 A.D.\" It would probably be difficult to date such legends as\\r\\nthose of St. Margaret and St. Catherine too early, having regard to\\r\\ntheir intrinsic indications: and the vast cycle of Our Lady, though\\r\\nprobably later, must have begun long before the modern languages were\\r\\nready for it, while that of the Cross should be earlier still. And let\\r\\nit be remembered that these Saints\\' Lives, which are still infinitely\\r\\ngood reading, are not in the least confined to homiletic necessities.\\r\\nThe jejuneness and woodenness from which the modern religious story too\\r\\noften suffers are in no way chargeable upon all, or even many, of them.\\r\\nThey have the widest range of incident—natural as well as supernatural:\\r\\ntheir touches of nature are indeed extended far beyond mere incident.\\r\\nPurely comic episodes are by no means wanting: and these, like the\\r\\nparallel passages in the dramatising of these very legends, were sure to\\r\\nlead to isolation of them, and to a secular continuation.\\nBut, once more, we must contract the sweep, and quicken the pace to deal\\r\\nnot with possible origins, but with actual results—not with Ancient or\\r\\nTransition literature, but with the literature of English in the\\r\\ndepartment first of fiction generally and then, with a third and last\\r\\nnarrowing, to the main subject of English fiction in prose.\\nThe very small surviving amount, and the almost completely second-hand\\r\\ncharacter, of Anglo-Saxon literature have combined to frustrate what\\r\\nmight have been expected from another characteristic of it—the unusual\\r\\nequality of its verse and prose departments. We have only one—not\\r\\nquite entire but substantive—prose tale in Anglo-Saxon, the version of\\r\\nthe famous story of Apollonius of Tyre, which was to be afterwards\\r\\ndeclined by Chaucer, but attempted by his friend and contemporary Gower,\\r\\nand to be enshrined in the most certain of the Shakespearean\\r\\n\"doubtfuls,\" Pericles. It most honestly gives itself out as a\\r\\ntranslation (no doubt from the Latin though there was an early Greek\\r\\noriginal) and it deals briefly with the subject. But as an example of\\r\\nnarrative style it is very far indeed from being contemptible: and in\\r\\npassages such as Apollonius\\' escape from shipwreck, and his wooing of\\r\\nthe daughter of Arcestrates, there is something which is different from\\r\\nstyle, and with which style is not always found in company—that faculty\\r\\nof telling a story which has been already referred to. Nor does this\\r\\nfail in the narrative portions of the prose Saints\\' Lives and Homilies,\\r\\nespecially Aelfric\\'s, which we possess; in fact it is in these last\\r\\ndistinctly remarkable—as where Aelfric tells the tale of the monk who\\r\\nspied on St. Cuthbert\\'s seaside devotions. The same faculty is\\r\\nobservable in Latin work, not least in Bede\\'s still more famous telling\\r\\nof the Caedmon story, and of the vision of the other world.\\nBut these faculties have better chance of exhibiting themselves in the\\r\\nverse division of our Anglo-Saxon wreckage. Beowulf itself consists of\\r\\none first-rate story and one second-rate but not despicable tale,\\r\\nhitched together more or less anyhow. The second, with good points, is,\\r\\nfor us, negligible: the first is a \"yarn\" of the primest character. One\\r\\nmay look back to the Odyssey itself without finding anything so good,\\r\\nexcept the adventures of the Golden Ass which had all the story-work of\\r\\ntwo mightiest literatures behind them. As literature on the other hand,\\r\\nBeowulf may be overpraised: it has been so frequently. But let\\r\\nanybody with the slightest faculty of \"conveyance\" tell the first part\\r\\nof the story to a tolerably receptive audience, and he will not doubt\\r\\n(unless he is fool enough to set the effect down to his own gifts and\\r\\ngraces) about its excellence as such. There is character—not much, but\\r\\nenough to make it more than a mere story of adventure—and adventure\\r\\nenough for anything; there is by no means ineffectual speech—even\\r\\ndialogue—of a kind: and there is some effective and picturesque\\r\\ndescription. The same faculties reappear in such mere fragments as that\\r\\nof Waldhere and the \"Finnsburgh\" fight: but they are shown much more\\r\\nfully in the Saints\\' Lives—best of all in the Andreas, no doubt, but\\r\\nremarkably also (especially considering the slender amount of\\r\\n\"happenings\") in the Guthlac and the Juliana. In fact the very\\r\\nfragments of Anglo-Saxon poetry, by a sort of approximation which they\\r\\nshow to dramatic narrative and which with a few exceptions is far less\\r\\npresent in the classics, foretell much more clearly and certainly than\\r\\nin the case of some other foretellings which have been detected in them,\\r\\nthe future achievements of English literature in the department of\\r\\nfiction. The Ruin (the finest thing perhaps in all Anglo-Saxon) is a\\r\\nsort of background study for something that might have been much better\\r\\nthan The Last Days of Pompeii: and The Complaint of Deor, in its\\r\\nallusion to the adventures of the smith Weland and others, makes one\\r\\nsorry that some one more like the historian of a later and decadent\\r\\nthough agreeable Wayland the Smith, had not told us the tale that is now\\r\\nleft untold. A crowd of fantastic imaginings or additions, to supply the\\r\\nmain substance, and a certain common-sense grasp of actual conditions\\r\\nand circumstances to set them upon, and contrast them with—these are\\r\\nthe great requirements of Fiction in life and character. You must mix\\r\\nprose and poetry to get a good romance or even novel. The consciences of\\r\\nthe ancients revolted from this mixture of kinds; but there was no such\\r\\nrevolt in the earlier moderns, and least of all in our own mediæval\\r\\nforefathers.\\nSo few people are really acquainted with the whole range of Romance\\r\\n(even in English), or with any large part of it, that one may without\\r\\nundue presumption set down in part, if not in whole, to ignorance, a\\r\\ndoctrine and position which we must now attack. This is that romance and\\r\\nnovel are widely separated from each other; and that the historian of\\r\\nthe novel is really straying out of his ground if he meddles with\\r\\nRomance. These are they who would make our proper subject begin with\\r\\nMarivaux and Richardson, or at earliest with Madame de La Fayette, who\\r\\nexclude Bunyan altogether, and sometimes go so far as to question the\\r\\nright of entry to Defoe. But the counter-arguments are numerous: and any\\r\\none of them would almost suffice by itself. In the first place the idea\\r\\nof the novel arising so late is unnatural and unhistorical: these\\r\\nMelchisedecs without father or mother are not known in literature. In\\r\\nthe second a pedantic insistence on the exclusive definition of the\\r\\nnovel involves one practical inconvenience which no one, even among\\r\\nthose who believe in it, has yet dared to face. You must carry your wall\\r\\nof partition along the road as well as across it: and write separate\\r\\nhistories of Novel and Romance for the last two centuries. The present\\r\\nwriter can only say that, though he has dared some tough adventures in\\r\\nliterary history, he would altogether decline this. Without the help of\\r\\nthe ants that succoured Psyche against Venus that heap would indeed be\\r\\nill to sort.\\nBut there is a third argument, less practical in appearance but bolder\\r\\nand deeper, which is really decisive of the matter, though few seem to\\r\\nhave seen it or at least taken it up. The separation of romance and\\r\\nnovel—of the story of incident and the story of character and\\r\\nmotive—is a mistake logically and psychologically. It is a very old\\r\\nmistake, and it has deceived some of the elect: but a mistake it is. It\\r\\nmade even Dr. Johnson think Fielding shallower than Richardson; and it\\r\\nhas made people very different from Dr. Johnson think that Count Tolstoi\\r\\nis a greater analyst and master of a more developed humanity than\\r\\nFielding. As a matter of fact, when you have excogitated two or more\\r\\nhuman beings out of your own head and have set them to work in the\\r\\nnarrative (not the dramatic) way, you have made the novel in posse, if\\r\\nnot in esse, from its apparently simplest development, such as\\r\\nDaphnis and Chloe, to its apparently most complex, such as the\\r\\nKreutzer Sonata or the triumphs of Mr. Meredith. You have started the\\r\\n\"Imitation\"—the \"fiction\"—and tout est là. The ancients could do\\r\\nthis in the dramatic way admirably, though on few patterns; in the\\r\\npoetical way as admirably, but again not on many. The Middle Ages lost\\r\\nthe dramatic way almost entirely, but they actually improved the\\r\\npoetical on its narrative side, and the result was Romance. In every\\r\\nromance there is the germ of a novel and more; there is at least the\\r\\nsuggestion and possibility of romance in every novel that deserves the\\r\\nname. In the Tristram story and the Lancelot cycle there are most of the\\r\\nthings that the romancer of incident and the novelist of character and\\r\\nmotive can want or can use, till the end of the world; and Malory (that\\r\\n\"mere compiler\" as some pleasantly call him) has put the possibilities\\r\\nof the latter and greater creation so that no one who has eyes can miss\\r\\nthem. Nor in the beginning does it much or at all matter whether the\\r\\nvehicle was prose or verse. In fact they mostly wrote in verse because\\r\\nprose was not ready.\\nIn the minor romances and tales (taking English versions only) from\\r\\nHavelok to Beryn there is a whole universe of situation, scenario,\\r\\nopportunity for \"business.\" That they have the dress and the\\r\\nscene-backing of one particular period can matter to no one who has eyes\\r\\nfor anything beyond dress and scene-backing. And when we are told that\\r\\nthey are apt to run too much into grooves and families, it is sufficient\\r\\nto answer that it really does not lie in the mouth of an age which\\r\\nproduces grime-novels, problem-novels, and so forth, as if they had been\\r\\nstruck off on a hectograph, possessing the not very exalted gift of\\r\\nvarying names and places—to reproach any other age on this score. But\\r\\nwe have only limited room here for generalities and still less for\\r\\ncontroversy; let us turn to our proper work and survey the actual\\r\\nturn-out in fiction—mostly as a result of mere fashion, verse, but\\r\\npartly prose—which the Middle Ages has left us as a contribution to\\r\\nthis department of English literature.\\nIt has been said that few people know the treasures of English romance,\\r\\nyet there is little excuse for ignorance of them. It is some century\\r\\nsince Ellis\\'s extremely amusing, if sometimes rather prosaic, book put\\r\\nmuch of the matter before those who will not read originals; to be\\r\\nfollowed in the same path by Dunlop later, and much later still by the\\r\\ninvaluable and delightful Catalogue of [British Museum] Romances by\\r\\nMr. Ward. It is nearly as long since the collections of Ritson and\\r\\nWeber, soon supplemented by others, and enlarged for the last forty\\r\\nyears by the publications of the Early English Text Society, put these\\r\\noriginals themselves within the reach of everybody who is not so lazy\\r\\nor so timid as to be disgusted or daunted by a very few actually\\r\\nobsolete words and a rather large proportion of obsolete spellings,\\r\\nwhich will yield to even the minimum of intelligent attention. Only a\\r\\nvery small number (not perhaps including a single one of importance)\\r\\nremain unprinted, though no doubt a few are out of print or difficult to\\r\\nobtain. The quality and variety of the stories told in them are both\\r\\nvery considerable, even without making allowance for what has been\\r\\ncalled the stock character of mediæval composition. That almost all are\\r\\ndirectly imitated from the French is probable enough, that most are is\\r\\ncertain: but this matters, for our purpose, nothing at all. That the\\r\\nimitation was not haphazard or indiscriminate is obvious. Thus, though\\r\\nwe have some, we have not very many representatives of the class which\\r\\nwas the most numerous of all in France—the chansons de geste or\\r\\nstories of French legendary history, national or family. Except as far\\r\\nas the Saracens are concerned, they would naturally have less interest\\r\\nfor English hearers. The Matière de Rome, again—the legends of\\r\\nantiquity—though represented, is not very abundant outside of the\\r\\nuniversally popular Tale of Troy; and the almost equally popular\\r\\nAlexander legend does not occupy a very large part of them. What is\\r\\nperhaps more remarkable is that until Malory exercised his genius upon\\r\\n\"the French book,\" the more poetical parts of the \"matter of Britain\"\\r\\nitself do not seem to have been very much written about in English. The\\r\\npreliminary stuff about Merlin and Vortigern exists in several\\r\\nhandlings; the foreign campaigns of Arthur seem always (perhaps from\\r\\nnational vanity) to have been popular. The \"off\"-branches of Tristram\\r\\nand Percivale, and not a few of the still more episodic romances of\\r\\nadventures concerning Gawain, Iwain, and other knights, receive\\r\\nattention. The execrable Lonelich or Lovelich, who preceded Malory a\\r\\nlittle, had of course predecessors in handling the other parts of the\\r\\nGraal story. But the crown and flower of the whole—the inspiration\\r\\nwhich connected the Round Table and the Graal and the love of Lancelot\\r\\nand Guinevere—though, so far as the present writer\\'s reading and\\r\\nopinion are of any weight, the recent attempts to deprive the\\r\\nEnglishman, Walter Map, of the honour of conceiving it are of no\\r\\nforce—seems to have waited till the fifteenth century—that is to say\\r\\nthe last part of three hundred years—before Englishmen took it up. Most\\r\\npopular of all perhaps, on the principle that in novels the flock \"likes\\r\\nthe savour of fresh grass,\" seem to have been the pure romans\\r\\nd\\'aventures—quite unconnected or nearly so with each other or with any\\r\\nof the larger cycles. Those adventures of particular heroes have\\r\\nsometimes a sort of Arthurian link, but they really have no more to do\\r\\nwith the main Arthurian story than if Arthur were not.\\nFor the present purpose, however, filiation, origin, and such-like\\r\\nthings are of much less importance than the actual stories that get\\r\\nthemselves told to satisfy that demand which in due time is to produce\\r\\nthe supply of the novel. Of these the two oldest, as regards the actual\\r\\nforms in which we have them, are capital examples of the more and less\\r\\noriginal handling of \"common-form\" stories or motives. They were not\\r\\nthen, be it remembered, quite such common-form as now—the rightful heir\\r\\nkept out of his rights, the usurper of them, the princess gracious or\\r\\nscornful or both by turns, the quest, the adventure, the revolutions and\\r\\ndiscoveries and fights, the wedding bells and the poetical justice on\\r\\nthe villain. Let it be remembered, too, if anybody is scornful of these\\r\\nas vieux jeu, that they have never been really improved upon except by\\r\\nthe very obvious and unoriginal method common in clever-silly days, of\\r\\nsimply reversing some of them, of \"turning platitudes topsy-turvy,\" as\\r\\nnot the least gifted, or most old-fashioned, of novelists, Tourguenief,\\r\\nhas it. Perhaps the oldest of all, Havelok the Dane—a story the age\\r\\nof which from evidence both internal and external, is so great that\\r\\npeople have not quite gratuitously imagined a still older Danish or even\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon original for the French romance from which our existing one\\r\\nis undoubtedly taken—is one of the most spirited of all. Both hero and\\r\\nheroine—Havelok, who should be King of Denmark and Goldborough, who\\r\\nshould be Queen of England—are ousted by their treacherous\\r\\nguardian-viceroys as infants; and Havelok is doomed to drowning by his\\r\\ntutor, the greater or at least bolder villain of the two. But the\\r\\nfisherman Grim, who is chosen as his murderer, discovers that the child\\r\\nhas, at night, a nimbus of flame round his head; renounces his crime\\r\\nand escapes by sea with the child and his own family to Grimsby.\\r\\nHavelok, growing up undistinguished from his foster-brethren, takes\\r\\nservice as a scullion with the English usurper. This usurper is seeking\\r\\nhow to rid himself of the princess without violence, but in some way\\r\\nthat will make her succession to the crown impossible, and Havelok\\r\\nhaving shown prowess in sports is selected as the maiden\\'s husband. She,\\r\\ntoo, discovers his royalty at night by the same token; and the pair\\r\\nregain their respective inheritances and take vengeance on their\\r\\nrespective traitors, in a lively and adventurous fashion. There are all\\r\\nthe elements of a good story in this: and they are by no means wasted or\\r\\nspoilt in the actual handling. It is not a mere sequence of incident;\\r\\nfrom the mixture of generosity and canniness in the fisherman who\\r\\nascertains that he is to have traitor\\'s wages before he finally decides\\r\\nto rescue Havelok, to the not unnatural repugnance of Goldborough at\\r\\nher forced wedding with a scullion, the points where character comes in\\r\\nare not neglected, though of course the author does not avail himself of\\r\\nthem either in Shakespearean or in Richardsonian fashion. They are\\r\\nthere, ready for development by any person who may take it into his\\r\\nhead to develop them.\\nSo too is it in the less powerful and rather more cut and dried King\\r\\nHorn. Here the opening is not so very different; the hero\\'s father is\\r\\nmurdered by pirate invaders, and he himself set adrift in a boat. But in\\r\\nthis the princess (daughter of course of the king who shelters him)\\r\\nherself falls in love with Horn, and there is even a scene of\\r\\nconsiderable comic capabilities in which she confides this affection by\\r\\nmistake to one of his companions (fortunately a faithful one) instead of\\r\\nto himself. But Horn has a faithless friend also; and rivals, and\\r\\nadventures, and journeys; and returns just in the nick of time, and\\r\\nrecognitions by rings, and everything that can properly be desired\\r\\noccur. In these—even more perhaps than in Havelok\\'s more masculine and\\r\\nless sentimental fortunes—there are openings not entirely neglected by\\r\\nthe romancer (though, as has been said, he does not seem to have been\\r\\none of the strongest of his kind) for digression, expatiation,\\r\\nembroidery. Transpose these two stories (as the slow kind years will\\r\\nteach novelists inevitably to do) into slightly different keys,\\r\\nintroduce variations and episodes and codas, and you have the\\r\\npossibilities of a whole library of fiction, as big and as varied as any\\r\\nthat has ever established itself for subscribers, and bigger than any\\r\\nthat has ever offered itself as one collection to buyers.\\nThe love-stories of these two tales are what it is the fashion—exceedingly\\r\\ncomplimentary to the age referred to if not to the age of the fashion\\r\\nitself—to call \"mid-Victorian\" in their complete \"propriety.\"\\r\\nIndeed, it is a Puritan lie, though it seems to possess the vivaciousness\\r\\nof its class, that the romances are distinguished by \"bold bawdry.\"\\r\\nThey are on the contrary rather singularly pure, and contrast, in\\r\\nthat respect, remarkably with the more popular folk-tale. But fiction,\\r\\nno more than drama, could do without the ἁμαρτἱα—the\\r\\nhuman and not unpardonable frailty. This appears in, and complicates,\\r\\nthe famous story of Tristram, which, though its present English form\\r\\nis probably younger than Havelok and Horn, is likely to have existed\\r\\nearlier: indeed must have done so if Thomas of Erceldoune wrote on the\\r\\nsubject. Few can require to be told that beautiful and tragical history\\r\\nof \"inauspicious stars\" which hardly any man, of the many who have\\r\\nhandled it in prose and verse, has been able to spoil. Our Middle\\r\\nEnglish form is not consummate, and is in some places crude in manner\\r\\nand in sentiment. But it is notable that the exaggerated and inartistic\\r\\nrepulsiveness of Mark, resorted to by later writers as a rather\\r\\nrudimentary means of exciting compassion for the lovers, is not to be\\r\\nfound here; in fact, one of the most poetical touches in the piece is\\r\\none of sympathy for the luckless husband, when he sees the face of his\\r\\nfaithless queen slumbering by her lover\\'s side with the sun on it. \"And\\r\\nMark rewed therefore.\" The story, especially in its completion with the\\r\\n\"Iseult of Brittany\" part and the death of Tristram, gives scope for\\r\\nevery possible faculty and craftsmanship of the most analytic as of the\\r\\nmost picturesque novelist of modern times. There is nothing in the least\\r\\nlike it in ancient literature; and to get a single writer who would do\\r\\nit justice in modern times we should have to take the best notes of\\r\\nCharles Kingsley, and Mr. Blackmore, and Mr. Meredith, leaving out all\\r\\ntheir faults, and combine. It is not surprising that, in the very\\r\\ninfancy of the art, nobody in German or French, any more than in English\\r\\n(though the German here is, as it happens, the best), should have done\\r\\nit full justice; but it is a wonder that a story of such capacities\\r\\nshould have been sketched, and even worked out in considerable detail,\\r\\nso early.\\nOf the far greater story of which Tristram is a mere episode and\\r\\nhardly even that—a chantry or out-lying chapel of the great\\r\\ncathedral—the Arthurian Legend, the earlier English versions, or rather\\r\\nthe earlier versions in English, are, as has been said, not only\\r\\nfragmentary but disappointing. There is nothing in the least strange in\\r\\nthis, even though (as the present writer, who can speak with indifferent\\r\\nknowledge, still firmly holds) the conception of the story itself in its\\r\\ngreatest and unifying stage is probably if not certainly English. The\\r\\noriginal sources of the story of Arthur are no doubt Celtic; they give\\r\\nthemselves out as being so, and there is absolutely no critical reason\\r\\nfor disbelieving them. But in these earlier forms—the authority of the\\r\\nmost learned Celticists who have any literary gift and any appreciation\\r\\nof evidence is decisive on this point—not only are the most\\r\\ncharacteristic unifying features—the Graal story and the love of\\r\\nLancelot and Guinevere—completely wanting, but the great stroke of\\r\\ngenius—the connection of these two and the subordination of all minor\\r\\nlegends as to the dim national hero, Arthur, with those about him—is\\r\\nmore conspicuously wanting still. Whether it was the Englishman Walter\\r\\nMap, the Norman Robert de Borron, or the Frenchman Chrestien de Troyes,\\r\\nto whom this flash of illumination came, has never been proved—will\\r\\npretty certainly now never be proved. M. Gaston Paris failed to do it;\\r\\nand it is exceedingly unlikely that, where he failed, any one else will\\r\\nsucceed, unless the thrice and thirty times sifted libraries of Europe\\r\\nyield some quite unexpected windfall. In the works commonly attributed\\r\\nto Chrestien, all of which are well known to the present writer, there\\r\\nis no sign of his having been able to conceive this, though he is a\\r\\ndelightful romancer. Robert is a mere shadow; and his attributed works,\\r\\nas his works, are shadows too, though they are interesting enough in\\r\\nthemselves. Walter not only has the greatest amount of traditional\\r\\nattribution, but is the undoubted author of De Nugis Curialium. And\\r\\nthe author of De Nugis Curialium, different as it is from the\\r\\nArthurian story, could have finally divined the latter.\\nBut at the time when he wrote, Englishmen, with the rarest exceptions,\\r\\nwrote only in French or Latin; and when they began to write in English,\\r\\na man of genius, to interpret and improve on him, was not found for a\\r\\nlong time. And the most interesting parts of the Arthurian story are\\r\\nrarely handled at all in such early vernacular versions of it as we\\r\\nhave, whether in verse or prose. Naturally enough, perhaps, it was the\\r\\nfabulous historic connection with British history, and the story of the\\r\\ngreat British enchanter Merlin, that attracted most attention. The\\r\\nArthour and Merlin which is in the Auchinleck MS.; the prose Merlin,\\r\\npublished by the Early English Text Society; the alliterative Thornton\\r\\nMorte d\\'Arthur, and others, are wont to busy themselves about the\\r\\nantecedents of the real story—about the uninteresting wars of the King\\r\\nhimself with Saxons, and Romans, and giants, and rival kings, rather\\r\\nthan with the great chivalric triple cord of Round Table, Graal, and\\r\\nGuinevere\\'s fault. The pure Graal poems, Joseph of Arimathea, the work\\r\\nof the abominable Lonelich or Lovelich, etc., deal mainly with another\\r\\nbranch of previous questions—things bearable as introductions,\\r\\nfillings-up, and so forth, but rather jejune in themselves. The Scots\\r\\nLancelot is later than Malory himself, and of very little interest.\\r\\nLayamon\\'s account, the oldest that we have, adds little (though what\\r\\nlittle it does add is not unimportant) to Geoffrey of Monmouth and Wace;\\r\\nand tells what it has to tell with nearly as little skill in narrative\\r\\nas in poetry. Only the metrical Morte—from which, it would appear,\\r\\nMalory actually transprosed some of his most effective passages in the\\r\\nmanner in which genius transproses or transverses—has, for that reason,\\r\\nfor its dealings with the catastrophe, and for the further opportunity\\r\\nof comparison with Tennyson, interest of the higher kind. But before we\\r\\ncome to Malory himself it is desirable to turn to the branches—the\\r\\nchapels, as we have called them, to the cathedral—which he also, in\\r\\nsome cases at least, utilised in the magnum opus of English prose\\r\\nromance.\\nThese outliers were rather more fortunate, probably for no more\\r\\nrecondite reason than that the French originals (from which they were in\\r\\nalmost every instance certainly taken) were finished in themselves. Of\\r\\nthe special Gawain cycle or sub-cycle we have two romances in pure\\r\\nmetrical form, and more than two in alliterative, which are above the\\r\\naverage in interest. Ywain and Gawain, one of the former, is derived\\r\\ndirectly or indirectly from the Chevalier au Lyon of Chrestien de\\r\\nTroyes; and both present some remarkable affinities with the unknown\\r\\noriginal of the \"Sir Beaumains\" episode of Malory, and, through it, with\\r\\nTennyson\\'s Gareth and Lynette. The other, Lybius Disconus (Le Beau\\r\\nDéconnu) is also concerned with that courteous nephew of Arthur who, in\\r\\nlater versions of the main story, is somewhat sacrificed to Lancelot.\\r\\nFor a \"real romance,\" as it calls itself (though it is fair to say\\r\\nthat in the original the word means \"royal\"), of the simpler kind but\\r\\nextremely well told, there are not many better metrical specimens than\\r\\nYwain and Gawain, but it has less character-interest, actual or\\r\\npossible, than those which have been commented on. The hero, King\\r\\nUrien\\'s son, accepts an adventure in which another knight of the Table,\\r\\nSir Colgrevance, has fared ill, after it has been told in a conversation\\r\\nat court which is joined in first by the Queen and afterwards by the\\r\\nKing. Sir Kay here shows his usual cross-grainedness; and Guinevere\\r\\n\"with milde mood\" requests to know \"What the devil is thee within?\" The\\r\\nadventure is of a class well known in romance. You ride to a certain\\r\\nfountain, pour water from it on a stone, and then, after divers marvels,\\r\\nhave to do battle with a redoubtable knight. Colgrevance has fared\\r\\nbadly; Kay is as usual quite sure that he would fare better; but Ywain\\r\\nactually undertakes the task. He has a tough battle with the knight who\\r\\nanswers the challenge, but wounds him mortally; and when the knight\\r\\nflies to his neighbouring castle, is so hard on his heels that the\\r\\nportcullis actually drops on his horse\\'s haunches just behind the\\r\\nsaddle, and cuts the beast in two. Ywain is thus left between the\\r\\nportcullis and the (by this time shut) door—a position all the more\\r\\nawkward that the knight himself expires immediately after he has reached\\r\\nshelter. The situation is saved, however, by the guardian damsel of\\r\\nromance, Lunet (the Linet or Lynette of the Beaumains-Gareth story), who\\r\\nemerges from a postern between gate and portcullis and conveys the\\r\\nintruder safe to her own chamber. Here a magic bed makes him invisible:\\r\\nthough the whole castle, including the very room, is ransacked by the\\r\\ndead knight\\'s people and would-be revengers, at the bidding of his\\r\\nwidow.\\nThis widow, however, is rather an Ephesian matron. The sagacious Lunet,\\r\\nwhose confidante she is, suggests to her that, unless she enlists some\\r\\ndoughty knight as her champion, the king will confiscate her fief; and\\r\\nthat there is no champion like a husband. A very little more finesse\\r\\neffects the marriage, even though the lady is made aware of the identity\\r\\nof her new lover and her own husband\\'s slayer. (It is of course\\r\\nnecessary to remember that the death of a combatant in fairly challenged\\r\\nand fought single contest was not reckoned as any fault to his\\r\\nantagonist.) Ywain actually shows his prowess against the King: and has\\r\\nan opportunity of showing Kay once more that it is one thing to blame\\r\\nother people for failing, and another to succeed yourself. And after\\r\\nthis the newly married pair live together happily for a time. But it was\\r\\nreckoned a fault in a knight to take too prolonged a honeymoon: and\\r\\nYwain, after what the French call adieux déchirants, obtains leave for\\r\\nthe usual \"twelvemonth and a day,\" at the expiration of which, on St.\\r\\nJohn\\'s Eve, he is without fail to return, the engagement being sealed by\\r\\nthe gift from his lady of a special ring. He forgets his promise of\\r\\ncourse: and at the stated time a damsel appears, sternly demands the\\r\\nring, and announces her lady\\'s decision to have nothing further to do\\r\\nwith him. There is in such cases only one thing for any true knight,\\r\\nfrom Sir Lancelot to Sir Amadis, to do: and that is to go mad, divest\\r\\nhimself of his garments, and take to the greenwood. This Ywain duly\\r\\ndoes, supporting himself at first on the raw flesh of game which he\\r\\nkills with a bow and arrows wrested from a chance-comer; and then on\\r\\nless savage but still simple food supplied by a benevolent hermit. As he\\r\\nlies asleep under a tree, a lady rides by with attendants, and one of\\r\\nthese (another of the wise damsels of romance) recognises him as Sir\\r\\nYwain. The lady has at the time sore need of a champion against a\\r\\nhostile earl, and she also fortunately possesses a box of ointment\\r\\ninfallible against madness, which Morgane la Faye has given her. With\\r\\nthis the damsel is sent back to anoint Ywain. He comes to his senses, is\\r\\narmed and clothed, undertakes the lady\\'s defence, and discomfits the\\r\\nearl: but is as miserable as ever. Resisting the lady\\'s offer of herself\\r\\nand all her possessions, he rides off once more \"with heavy heart and\\r\\ndreary cheer.\"\\nSoon he hears a hideous noise and, riding in its direction, finds that a\\r\\ndragon has attacked a lion. He succours the holier beast, kills the\\r\\ndragon, and though he has unavoidably wounded the lion in the mêlée is\\r\\nthenceforth attended by him not merely as a food-provider, but as the\\r\\ndoughtiest of squires and comrades in fight. To aggravate his sorrow he\\r\\ncomes to the fountain and thorn-tree of the original adventure, and\\r\\nhears some one complaining in the chapel hard by. They exchange\\r\\nquestions. \"A man,\" he said, \"some time I was\" (which must be one of the\\r\\nearliest occurrences in English of a striking phrase), and the prisoner\\r\\nturns out to be Lunet. She has been accused of treason by the usual\\r\\nsteward (it is very hard for a steward of romance to be good) and two\\r\\nbrothers—of treason to her lady, and is to be burnt, unless she can\\r\\nfind a knight who will fight the three. Ywain agrees to defend her: but\\r\\nbefore he can carry out his promise he has, on the same morning, to meet\\r\\na terrible giant who is molesting his hosts at a castle where he is\\r\\nguested. Both adventures, however, are achieved on the same day, with\\r\\nvery notable aid from the lion: and Ywain undertakes a fresh one, being\\r\\nrecruited by the necessary damsel-messenger, against two half-fiend\\r\\nbrother knights. They stipulate that the lion is to be forcibly\\r\\nprevented from interfering, and he is locked up in a room; but, hearing\\r\\nthe noise of battle, he scratches up the earth under the door, frees\\r\\nhimself, and once more succours his master at the nick of time. Even\\r\\nthis does not expiate Ywain\\'s fault: and yet another task falls to\\r\\nhim—the championship of the rights of the younger of a pair of sisters,\\r\\nthe elder of whom has secured no less a representative than Gawain\\r\\nhimself. The pair, unknowing and unknown, fight all day long before\\r\\nArthur\\'s court with no advantage on either side: and when the light\\r\\nfails an interchange of courtesies leads to recognition and the\\r\\nsettlement of the dispute. Now the tale is nearly full. Ywain rides yet\\r\\nagain to the magic fountain and performs the rite; there is no one to\\r\\nmeet him; the castle rocks and the inmates quake. But the crafty Lunet\\r\\npersuades her mistress to swear that if the Knight of the Lion, who has\\r\\nfallen at variance with his lady, will come to the rescue, she will do\\r\\nall she can to reconcile the pair. Which not ill-prepared \"curtain\" duly\\r\\nfalls: leaving us comfortably assured that Ywain and his Lady and Lunet\\r\\nand the Lion (one wishes that these two could have made a match of it,\\r\\nand he must surely have been a bewitched knight) lived happily\\n\\n\"Until that death had driven them down.\"\\n\\nThis, it has been said, is a specimen of the pure romance; with little\\r\\nexcept incident in it, and a touch or two of manners. It does not, as\\r\\nthe others noticed above do, lend itself much to character-drawing. But\\r\\nit is spiritedly told; though rougher, it is much more vigorous than the\\r\\nFrench original; and the mere expletives and stock phrases, which are\\r\\nthe curse of these romances, do not obtrude themselves too much. In this\\r\\nrespect, and some others, it is the superior of the one coupled above\\r\\nwith it, Lybius Disconus, which is closer, except in names, to the\\r\\nBeaumains story. Still, this also is not a bad specimen of the same\\r\\nclass. The hero of it is a son, not a brother, of Gawain, comes nameless\\r\\nor nicknamed, but as \"Beaufils,\" not \"Beaumains,\" to Arthur\\'s court, and\\r\\nis knighted at once, not made to go through the \"kitchen-knave\" stage.\\r\\nAccordingly, the damsel Elene (not Lunet), to whom he is assigned as\\r\\nchampion in the adventure of the Lady of Sinadowne, objects only to his\\r\\nnovelty of knighthood and is converted by his first victory. The course\\r\\nof the adventures is, however, different from that which some people\\r\\nknow from Malory, and many from Tennyson. One of them is farcical: the\\r\\nFair Unknown rescues a damsel at her utmost need from two giants, a red\\r\\nand a black, one of whom is roasting a wild boar and uses the animal as\\r\\na weapon, with the spit in it, for the combat. Moreover, he falls a\\r\\nvictim to the wiles of a sorceress-chatelaine whom he has also\\r\\nsuccoured: and it is only after the year and day that Elene goads him on\\r\\nto his proper quest. But this also is no bad story.\\nThe limits of this volume admit of not much farther \"argument\" (though\\r\\nthe writer would very gladly give it) of these minor romances of\\r\\nadventure, Arthurian and other. Ellis\\'s easily accessible book supplies\\r\\nabstracts of the main Arthurian story before Malory; of the two most\\r\\nfamous, though by no means best, of all the non-Arthurian romances, Guy\\r\\nof Warwick and Bevis of Hampton (the former of which was handled and\\r\\nrehandled from age to age, moralised, curtailed, lengthened, and hashed\\r\\nup in every form); of the brilliant and vigorous Richard\\r\\nCoeur-de-Lion; of the less racy Charlemagne romances in English; of the\\r\\nSeven Wise Masters, brought from the East and naturalised all over\\r\\nEurope; of the delightful love story of Florice and Blancheflour; of\\r\\nthat powerful and pathetic legend of the Proud King (Robert of\\r\\nSicily), which Longfellow and Mr. William Morris both modernised, each\\r\\nin his way; of those other legends, Sir Isumbras and Amis and\\r\\nAmillion, which are so beautiful to those who can appreciate the\\r\\nmediæval mind, and to the beauty of which others seem insensible; of\\r\\nSir Triamond and Sir Eglamour (examples of the romance at its\\r\\nweakest); of the exceedingly spirited and interesting Ipomydon, and of\\r\\nsome others, including the best of Scotch romances, Sir Eger, Sir\\r\\nGrame, and Sir Graysteel. But Ellis could not know others, and he left\\r\\nalone yet others that he might have known—the exquisite Sir Launfal\\r\\nof Thomas Chester at the beginning of the fifteenth century, where an\\r\\nunworthy presentment of Guinevere is compensated by the gracious image\\r\\nof Launfal\\'s fairy love; the lively adventures of William of Palerne,\\r\\nwho had a werewolf for his friend and an emperor\\'s daughter for his\\r\\nlove, eloping with her in white bear-skins, the unusual meat of which\\r\\nwas being cooked in her father\\'s kitchen; Sir Orfeo—Orpheus and\\r\\nEurydice, with a happy ending; Emarè, one of the tales of innocent but\\r\\npersecuted heroines of which Chaucer\\'s Constance is the best known;\\r\\nFlorence of Rome; the rather famous Squire of Low Degree; Sir\\r\\nAmadas, not a very good handling of a fine motive, charity to a corpse;\\r\\nmany others.\\nNor does he seem to have known one of the finest of all—the\\r\\nalliterative romance of Gawain and the Green Knight which, since Dr.\\r\\nMorris published it some forty years ago for the Early English Text\\r\\nSociety, has made its way through text-books into more general knowledge\\r\\nthan most of its fellows enjoy. In this the hero is tempted repeatedly,\\r\\nelaborately, and with great knowledge of nature and no small command of\\r\\nart on the teller\\'s part, by the wife of his host and destined\\r\\nantagonist. He resists in the main, but succumbs in the point of\\r\\naccepting a magic preservative as a gift: and is discovered and lectured\\r\\naccordingly. It is curious that this, which is far above the usual mere\\r\\nadventure-story and is novel of a high kind as well as romance, has no\\r\\nknown French original; and is strongly English in many characteristics\\r\\nbesides its verse-form.\\nOn the whole, however, one need have no difficulty in admitting that the\\r\\nmajority of these romances do somewhat content themselves with\\r\\nincident, incident only, and incident not merely of a naïf but of a\\r\\nstock kind, for their staple. There are striking situations, even striking\\r\\nphrases, here and there; there is plenty of variety in scene, and more than\\r\\nis sometimes thought in detail; but the motive-and-character-interest is\\r\\nrarely utilised as it might be, and very generally is not even suggested.\\r\\nThere is seldom any real plot or \"fable\"—only a chain of events: and\\r\\nthough no one but a very dull person will object to the supernatural\\r\\nelement, or to the exaggerated feats of professedly natural prowess and\\r\\nendurance, it cannot be said that on the whole they are artistically\\r\\nmanaged. You feel, not merely that the picture would have been better if\\r\\nthe painter had taken more pains, but that the reason why he did not\\r\\nis that he did not know how.\\nSir Thomas Malory, himself most unknown perhaps of all great writers,\\r\\ndid know how; and a cynical person might echo the I nunc of the Roman\\r\\nsatirist, and dwell on the futility of doing great things, in reference\\r\\nto the fact that it used to be fashionable, and is still not uncommon,\\r\\nto call Malory a \"mere compiler.\" Indeed from the direction which modern\\r\\nstudy so often takes, of putting inquiry into origins above everything,\\r\\nand neglecting the consideration of the work as work, this practice is\\r\\nnot likely soon to cease. But no mistake about the mysterious\\r\\nEnglishman (the place-names with which the designation is connected are\\r\\nall pure English) is possible to any one who has read his book, and who\\r\\nknows what prose fiction is. The Noble Histories of King Arthur, La\\r\\nMorte d\\'Arthur, The Story of the most Noble and Worthy King Arthur, The\\r\\nMost Ancient and Famous History of the Renowned Prince Arthur, The\\r\\nBirth, Life, and Acts of King Arthur—call it by whichever name anybody\\r\\nlikes of those which various printers and reprinters have given it—is\\r\\none of the great books of the world. If they can give us any single\\r\\n\"French book\"—the reference to which is a commonplace of the\\r\\nsubject—from which it was taken, let them; they have not yet. If they\\r\\npoint out (as they can) French and English books from which parts of it\\r\\nwere taken, similar things may be done with Dante and Chaucer, with\\r\\nShakespeare and Milton, and very probably could have been done with\\r\\nHomer. It is what the artist does with his materials, not where he gets\\r\\nthem, that is the question. And Malory has done, with his materials, a\\r\\nvery great thing indeed. He is working no doubt to a certain extent\\r\\nblindly; working much better than he knows, and sometimes as he would\\r\\nnot work if he knew better; though whether he would work as well if he\\r\\nknew better is quite a different point. Sometimes he may not take the\\r\\nbest available version of a story; but we must ask ourselves whether he\\r\\nknew it. Sometimes he may put in what we do not want: but we must ask\\r\\nourselves whether there was not a reason for doing so, to him if not to\\r\\nus. What is certain is that he, and he only in any language, makes of\\r\\nthis vast assemblage of stories one story, and one book. He does it\\r\\n(much more than half unconsciously no doubt) by following the lines of,\\r\\nas I suppose, Walter Map, and fusing the different motives, holding to\\r\\nthis method even in parts of the legend with which, so far as one knows,\\r\\nMap cannot have meddled. Before him this legend consisted of half a\\r\\ndozen great divisions—a word which may be used of malice prepense.\\r\\nThese were the story of Merlin, that of Arthur\\'s own origin, and that of\\r\\nthe previous history of the Graal for introduction; the story of\\r\\nArthur\\'s winning the throne, of the Round Table, and of the marriage\\r\\nwith Guinevere, also endless branchings of special knights\\' adventures,\\r\\nand of the wars with the Saxons and the Romans, and the episode of the\\r\\nFalse Guinevere—with whom for a time Arthur lives as with his\\r\\nqueen—for middle; and the story of the Graal-quest, the love of\\r\\nLancelot for the Queen, and the rebellion of Mordred with its fatal\\r\\nconsequences, for close. Exactly how much of this Malory personally had\\r\\nbefore him we cannot of course say: but of any working up of the whole\\r\\nthat would have spared him trouble, and robbed him of credit, we do not\\r\\nknow. In fact the favourite term \"compiler\" gives up the only dangerous\\r\\npoint. Now in what way did Malory compile? In the way in which the\\r\\nordinary compiler proceeds he most emphatically does not. He cuts down\\r\\nthe preliminaries mercilessly: but they can be perfectly well spared. He\\r\\nmisses almost all the wars with the Saxons, which are the most tedious\\r\\nparts of the originals. He adopts, most happily, the early, not the\\r\\nlate, placing of those with the Romans. He drops the false Guinevere\\r\\naltogether, which is imperative, that the true one may have no right to\\r\\nplead the incident—though he does not represent Arthur as \"blameless.\"\\r\\nHe gives the roman d\\'aventures side of the Round Table stories, from\\r\\nthe great Tristram and Palomides romances through the Beaumains episode\\r\\ndownwards, because they are interesting in themselves and lead up to\\r\\nthe Graal quest. He gives that Quest as plentifully because it leads up\\r\\nto the \"dolorous death and departing out of this world of them all.\" How\\r\\nhe gives the Lancelot and Guinevere tragedy we shall see presently. And\\r\\nthe catastrophe of the actual \"departing\" he gives perfectly; with the\\r\\nmagnificent final scenes which he has converted, sometimes in almost\\r\\nShakespearean fashion, by the slightest verbal touches from mediocre\\r\\nverse to splendid prose. A very remarkable compiler! It is a pity that\\r\\nthey did not take him and cut him up in little stars for a light to all\\r\\nhis brethren in compiling thereafter.\\nFor he has what no compiler as such can have—because the moment he has\\r\\nit he ceases to be a compiler, and becomes an artist—the sense of\\r\\ngrasp, the power to put his finger, and to keep it, on the central\\r\\npulse and nerve of the story. That he did this deliberately is so\\r\\nunlikely as to be practically impossible: that he did it is certain. The\\r\\nArthurian Legend is the greatest of mediæval creations as a subject—a\\r\\n\"fable\"—just as the Divina Commedia is the greatest of mediæval\\r\\n\"imitations\" and works of art. And as such it is inevitable that it\\r\\nshould carry with it the sense of the greatest medieval differences,\\r\\nChivalry and Romance. The strong point of these differences is the way\\r\\nin which they combine the three great motives, as Dante isolates them,\\r\\nof Valour, Love, and Religion. The ancients never realised this\\r\\ncombination at all; the moderns have merely struggled after it, or\\r\\nblasphemed it in fox-and-grapes fashion: the mediævals had it—in\\r\\ntheory at any rate. The Round Table stories, merely as such, illustrate\\r\\nValour; the Graal stories, Religion; the passion of Lancelot and\\r\\nGuinevere with the minor instances, Love. All these have their\\r\\nἁμαρτἱα—their tragic and tragedy-causing fault and flaw. The knight\\r\\nwastes his valour in idle bickerings; he forgets law in his love; and\\r\\nthough there is no actual degradation of religion, he fails to live up\\r\\nto the ideal that he does not actually forswear. To throw the\\r\\npresentation—the mimesis—of all this into perfectly worthy form\\r\\nwould probably have been too much for any single genius of that curious\\r\\ntime (when genius was so widely spread and so little concentrated)\\r\\nexcept Dante himself, whose hand found other work to do. To colour and\\r\\nshape the various fragments of the mosaic was the work of scores. To put\\r\\nthem together, if not in absolutely perfect yet in more than sufficient\\r\\nshape, was, so far as we know, the luck of Malory only: though some one\\r\\n(Map or another) had done a mighty day\\'s work long before in creating\\r\\nthe figure and the adventures of Lancelot and imagining the later quest\\r\\nof the Graal with the figure of Galahad—that \"improved Percivale,\" as\\r\\nthe seedsmen say.\\nBut besides this power of shaping (or even of merely combining)\\r\\nscattered elements into a story, Malory has another—the other of the\\r\\nfirst importance to the novelist proper—in his attraction to character,\\r\\nif not exactly in his making up of it. It has been said above that the\\r\\ndefect of the pure romances—especially those of continental origin—is\\r\\nthe absence of this. What the Greeks called διἁνοια—\"sentiment,\"\\r\\n\"thought,\" \"cast of thought,\" as it has been variously rendered—is even\\r\\nmore absent from them than plot or character itself: and of its almost\\r\\nnecessary connection with this latter they often seem to have no idea.\\r\\nVery rare is such a touch as that of Sir Amadas being unable at the feast\\r\\nto get rid of the memory of the unburied corpse, kept by enemies from the\\r\\nkindly earth that would hide it, and the rites that would help it to peace:\\r\\nstill rarer that in Guy of Warwick when the hero, at the height of\\r\\nhis fame and in the full enjoyment of his desires, looks from the tower and\\r\\nis struck by the selfishness and earthliness of his career. The first\\r\\nnotion is not \"improved\" in the original at all, and the second very badly;\\r\\nbut in most of the others such things do not even exist. Now the greater\\r\\nLegend is full of situations which encourage such thoughts, and even of\\r\\nexpressed thoughts that only need craftsmanship to turn them into the\\r\\ncornerstones of character-building, and the jewels, five or fifty words\\r\\nlong, of literature. The fate and metaphysical aid that determine the\\r\\nrelations of Tristram and Iseult; the unconscious incest of Arthur and\\r\\nMargause with its Greek-tragic consequence; the unrewarded fidelity of\\r\\nPalomides, and (an early instance of the soon to be triumphant allegory)\\r\\nhis fruitless chase of the Beast Glatissant; all these are matters in\\r\\npoint. But of course the main nursery of such things is the\\r\\nLancelot-and-Guinevere story itself. Nobody has yet made Guinevere a\\r\\nperson—nobody but Shakespeare could have done so perhaps, though\\r\\nShakespeare\\'s Guinevere would probably have been the greatest woman in\\r\\nall art. But Malory has not been the least successful with her: and of\\r\\nLancelot he has made, if only in study, one of the great characters of\\r\\nthat fictitious world which is so much truer than the real. And let no\\r\\none say that we are reading Tennyson or any one else into Malory. There\\r\\nare yet persons, at least at the time this was written not quite\\r\\nMethusalahs, who read the Morte d\\'Arthur before the Idylls appeared\\r\\nand who have never allowed even the Idylls to overlay their original\\r\\nidea of the most perfect and most gentle of knights.\\nIt is probable indeed that Malory invented little or nothing in the\\r\\nvarious situations, by which the character of Lancelot, and the history\\r\\nof his fatal love, are evolved. We know in most cases that this is so.\\r\\nIt is possible, too, that at first (probably because the possibilities\\r\\nhad not dawned on him, as it has been admitted they never did very\\r\\nconsciously) he has not made the most of the introduction of lover and\\r\\nlady. But when the interest becomes concentrated, as in the various\\r\\npassages of Guinevere\\'s wrath with her lover and their consequences, or\\r\\nin the final series of catastrophes, he is fully equal to the occasion.\\r\\nWe know—this time to his credit—how he has improved, in the act of\\r\\nborrowing them, the earlier verse-pictures of the final parting of the\\r\\nlovers, and there are many other episodes and juxtapositions of which as\\r\\nmuch may be said. That except as to Lancelot\\'s remorse (which after all\\r\\nis the great point) there is not much actual talk about motive and\\r\\nsentiment is nothing; or nothing but the condition of the time. The\\r\\nimportant point is that, as the electricians say, \"the house is wired\"\\r\\nfor the actual installation of character-novelling. There is here the\\r\\ncomplete scenario, and a good deal more, for a novel as long as\\r\\nClarissa and much more interesting, capable of being worked out in the\\r\\nmanner, not merely of Richardson himself, but of Mr. Meredith or Mr.\\r\\nHardy. It is a great romance, if not the greatest of romances: it has\\r\\na great novel, if not the greatest of novels, written in sympathetic ink\\r\\nbetween the lines, and with more than a little of the writing sometimes\\r\\nemerging to view.\\nLittle in the restricted space here available can be, though much might\\r\\nbe in a larger, said about the remaining attempts in English fiction\\r\\nbefore the middle of the sixteenth century. The later romances, down to\\r\\nthose of Lord Berners, show the character of the older with a certain\\r\\naddition of the \"conjuror\\'s supernatural\" of the Amadis school. But\\r\\nthe short verse-tales, especially those of the Robin Hood cycle, and\\r\\nsome of the purely comic kind, introduce an important variation of\\r\\ninterest: and even some of the longer, such as that Tale of Beryn,\\r\\nwhich used to be included in Chaucer\\'s works, vary the chivalrous model\\r\\nin a useful way. Still more important is the influence of the short\\r\\nprose tale:—first Latin, as in the Gesta Romanorum (which of course\\r\\nhad older and positively mediæval forerunners), then Italian and French.\\r\\nThe prose saved the writer from verbiage and stock phrase; the shortness\\r\\nfrom the tendency to \"watering out\" which is the curse of the long verse\\r\\nor prose romance. Moreover, to get point and appeal, it was especially\\r\\nnecessary to throw up the subject—incident, emotion, or whatever it\\r\\nwas—to bring it out; not merely to meander and palaver about it. But\\r\\nlanguage and literature were both too much in a state of transition to\\r\\nadmit of anything capital being done at this time. It was the great good\\r\\nfortune of England, corresponding to that experienced with Chaucer in\\r\\npoetry three quarters of a century earlier, that Malory came to give the\\r\\nsum and substance of what mediæval fiction could do in prose. For more,\\r\\nthe times and the men had to come.\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\nFROM LYLY TO SWIFT\\nDuring the dying-off of romance proper, or its transference from verse\\r\\nto prose in the late fifteenth and earlier sixteenth century, there is\\r\\nnot very much to note about prose fiction in England. But, as the\\r\\nconditions of modern literature fashioned themselves, a very great\\r\\ninfluence in this as in other departments was no doubt exercised with us\\r\\nby Italian, as well as some by Spanish in a way which may be postponed\\r\\nfor a little. The Italian prose tale had begun to exercise that\\r\\ninfluence as early as Chaucer\\'s time: but circumstances and atmosphere\\r\\nwere as yet unfavourable for its growth. It is a hackneyed truism that\\r\\nItalian society was very much more modern than any other in Europe at\\r\\nthis time—in fact it would not be a mere paradox to say that it was,\\r\\nand continued to be till the later sixteenth, much more modern than it\\r\\nhas ever been since—or till very recently. By \"modern\" is here meant\\r\\nthe kind of society which is fairly cultivated, fairly comfortable,\\r\\nfairly complicated with classes not very sharply separated from each\\r\\nother, not dominated by any very high ideals, tolerably corrupt, and\\r\\nsufficiently business-like. The Italian novella, of course, admits\\r\\nwild passions and extravagant crimes: but the general tone of it is\\r\\nbourgeois—at any rate domestic. With its great number of situations\\r\\nand motives, presented in miniature, careful work is necessary to bring\\r\\nout the effect: and, above all, there is abundant room for study of\\r\\nmanners, for proverbial and popular wisdom and witticism, for\\r\\n\"furniture\"—to use that word in a wide sense. Above all, the Italian\\r\\nmind, like the Greek, had an ethical twist—twist in more senses than\\r\\none, some would say, but that does not matter. Manners, morals,\\r\\nmotives—these three could not but displace, to some extent, mere\\r\\nincident: though there was generally incident of a poignant or piquant\\r\\nkind as well. In other words the novella was actually (though still in\\r\\nminiature) a novel in nature as well as in name. And these novelle\\r\\nbecame, as is generally known, common in English translations after the\\r\\nmiddle of the sixteenth century. Painter\\'s huge Palace of Pleasure\\r\\n(1566) is only the largest and best known of many translations, single\\r\\nand collected, of the Italian novellieri and the French tale-tellers,\\r\\ncontemporary, or of times more or less earlier.\\nFor some time, as almost everybody knows, these collections of\\r\\ntranslated matter served a purpose—great indeed, but somewhat outside\\r\\ntheir proper department—by furnishing the Elizabethan dramatists with a\\r\\nlarge part—perhaps the larger part—of their subjects. But they very\\r\\nsoon began to exercise it directly by suggesting the fictitious part of\\r\\nthe prose pamphlet—a department which, though infinitely less well\\r\\nknown than the plays, and still not very easy to know, holds almost the\\r\\nsecond position as representing the popular literature of the\\r\\nElizabethan time. And they also had—in one case certainly, in the other\\r\\nprobably—no little influence upon the two great Elizabethan works which\\r\\nin a manner founded the modern novel and the modern romance in\\r\\nEnglish—the Euphues of Lyly and the Arcadia of Sir Philip Sidney.\\nThe pamphlet stories (which are themselves often play-connected, as in\\r\\nthe case of Lodge\\'s Rosalynde and Greene\\'s Pandosto) do not require\\r\\nmuch notice, with one exception—Nash\\'s Jack Wilton or the Unfortunate\\r\\nTraveller, to which some have assigned a position equal, or perhaps\\r\\nsuperior in our particular subject, to that of the Arcadia or that of\\r\\nEuphues. This seems to the present writer a mistake: but as to appear\\r\\nimportant is (in a not wholly unreal sense) to be so, the piece shall be\\r\\nseparately considered. The rest are mostly marred by a superabundance of\\r\\nrather rudimentary art, and a very poor allowance of matter. There is\\r\\nhardly any character, and except in a few pieces, such as Lodge\\'s\\r\\nMargarite of America, there is little attempt to utilise new scenes\\r\\nand conditions. But the whole class has special interest for us in one\\r\\npeculiarity which makes it perhaps unreadable to any but students, and\\r\\nthat is its saturation with the Elizabethan conceit and word-play which\\r\\nis sometimes called Euphuism. Nor is this wonderful, considering that\\r\\nmore than one of these \"pamphlets\" is directly connected with the matter\\r\\nand the personages of Euphues itself. To this famous book, therefore,\\r\\nwe had better turn.\\nSome people, it is believed, have denied that Euphues is a novel at\\r\\nall; and some of these some have been almost indignant at its being\\r\\ncalled one. It is certainly, with Rasselas, the most remarkable\\r\\nexample, in English, of a novel which is to a great extent deprived of\\r\\nthe agrémens to which we have for some two centuries been accustomed\\r\\nin the kind, and, to a still greater, loaded with others which do not\\r\\nappeal to us. To put aside altogether its extraordinary and in a way\\r\\nepoch-making style, which gives it its main actual place in the history\\r\\nof English literature, it is further loaded with didactic digressions\\r\\nwhich, though certain later novelists have been somewhat peccant in the\\r\\nkind, have never been quite equalled—no, not in Rasselas itself or\\r\\nthe Fool of Quality. But if anybody, who has the necessary knowledge\\r\\nto understand, and therefore the necessary patience to tolerate, these\\r\\nknotty knarry envelopes, insertions, and excrescences, will for the\\r\\nmoment pay no attention to them, but merely strip them off, he will find\\r\\nthe carcass of a very tolerable novel left behind. The first plot of\\r\\nPhilautus—Euphues—Lucilla, and the successive jilting of the two\\r\\nfriends for each other and for Curio, is no mean novel-substance. Not\\r\\nBalzac himself, certainly no one of his successors, need disdain it: and\\r\\nmore than one of them has taken up something like it. The journey from\\r\\nNaples to London, and the episode of Fidus and Iffida, could have been\\r\\nworked up, in the good old three-volume days, to a most effective second\\r\\nvolume. And the picture of the court, with the further loves of\\r\\nPhilautus, Camilla, and the \"violet\" Frances, would supply a third of\\r\\nthemselves even if Euphues were left out, though some livelier\\r\\npresentation of his character (which Lyly himself was obviously too much\\r\\npersonally interested to make at all clear) would improve the whole\\r\\nimmensely. But it was still too early: the thing was not yet to be done.\\r\\nOnly, I do not know any book in which the possibilities, and even the\\r\\noutlines, of this thing were indicated and vaguely sketched earlier in\\r\\nany European language, unless it be the Lucretia and Euryalus of Æneas\\r\\nSilvius, which is much more confined in its scope.\\nThe fact is that the very confusedness, the many undeveloped sides, of\\r\\nEuphues, make it much more of an ancestor of the modern novel than if\\r\\nit were more of a piece. The quicquid agunt homines is as much the\\r\\nprovince of the novel as of the satire; and there is more than something\\r\\nof this as it affected Elizabethan times in Euphues. Men\\'s interest in\\r\\nmorals, politics, and education; their development of the modern idea of\\r\\nsociety; their taste for letters; their conceits and fancies—all these\\r\\nappear in it.\\nThe Arcadia stands in a different compartment. Euphues is very much\\r\\nsui generis: failure as it may be from some points of view, it\\r\\ndeserves the highest respect for this, and like most other things sui\\r\\ngeneris it was destined to propagate the genus, if only after many\\r\\ndays. The Arcadia was in intention certainly, and to great extent in\\r\\nactual fact, merely a carrying out of the attempt, common all over\\r\\nEurope (as a result of the critical searchings of heart of the\\r\\nItalians), to practise a new kind—the Heroic Romance of the sub-variety\\r\\ncalled pastoral. The \"heroic\" idea generally was (as ought to be, but\\r\\nperhaps is not, well known) to blend, after a fashion, classical and\\r\\nromantic characteristics—to substitute something like the classic unity\\r\\nof fable or plot for the mere \"meandering\" of romantic story, and to pay\\r\\nat least as much attention to character as the classics had paid,\\r\\ninstead of neglecting it altogether, as had recently though not always\\r\\nbeen the case in Romance. But the scheme retained on the other hand the\\r\\nvariety of incident and appeal of this latter: and especially assigned\\r\\nto Love the high place which Romance had given it. As for the\\r\\nPastoral—that is almost a story to itself, and a story which has been\\r\\nonly once (by Mr. W.W. Greg) satisfactorily, and then not quite\\r\\ncompletely, told. It is enough to say here, and as affecting our own\\r\\nsubject, that it supplied a new opportunity of gratifying the passion of\\r\\nthe Renaissance for imitating antiquity, at the same time permitting to\\r\\nno small extent the introduction of things that were really romantic,\\r\\nand above all providing a convention. The Heroic romance generally and\\r\\nthe Pastoral in particular went directly back to the Greek romances of\\r\\nHeliodorus and Longus: but they admitted many new and foreign elements.\\nAt the same time, bastard as the heroic romance was, it could not but\\r\\nexercise an important influence on the future of fiction, inasmuch as it\\r\\ncombined, or attempted to combine, with classical unity and mediæval\\r\\nvariety the more modern interest of manners and (sometimes) personality.\\r\\nSidney\\'s attempt (which, it must be remembered, is not certainly known\\r\\nto be wholly his as it stands, and is certainly known not to have been\\r\\nrevised by him for publication) exercised a very great influence in\\r\\nEnglish. For its popularity was enormous, and it doubtless served as\\r\\nshoehorn to draw on that of the English translations of French and\\r\\nSpanish romance which supplied, during the greater part of the\\r\\nseventeenth century, the want of original composition of the kind. The\\r\\nunconscionable amount of talk and of writing \"about it and about it\"\\r\\nwhich Euphues and the minor Euphuist romances display is at least as\\r\\nprominent in the Arcadia: and this talk rarely takes a form congenial\\r\\nto the modern novel reader\\'s demands. Moreover, though there really is a\\r\\nplot, and a sufficient amount of incident, this reader undoubtedly, and\\r\\nto no small extent justly, demands that both incident and plot shall be\\r\\nmore disengaged from their framework—that they should be brought into\\r\\nhigher relief, should stand out more than is the case. Yet further, the\\r\\npure character-interest is small—is almost nonexistent: and the\\r\\nrococo-mosaic of manners and sentiment which was to prove the curse of\\r\\nthe heroic romance generally prevents much interest being felt in that\\r\\ndirection.1 It would also be impossible to devise a style less suited\\r\\nto prose narrative, except of a very peculiar kind and on a small scale,\\r\\nthan that either of Euphues or of the Arcadia, which, though an\\r\\nuncritical tradition credits it with driving out Lyly\\'s, is practically\\r\\nonly a whelp of the same litter. Embarrassed, heavy, rhetorical, it has\\r\\nits place in the general evolution of English prose, and a proper and\\r\\nvaluable place too. But it is bad even for pure romance purposes: and\\r\\nnearly hopeless for the panoramic and kaleidoscopic variety which should\\r\\ncharacterise the novel. To the actual successors of the Arcadia in\\r\\nEnglish we shall come presently.\\nThe Unfortunate Traveller is of much less importance than the other\\r\\ntwo. It has obtained such reputation as it possesses, partly because of\\r\\nits invention or improvement of the fable of \"Surrey and Geraldine\";\\r\\nmore, and more justly, because it does work up a certain amount of\\r\\nhistorical material—the wars of Henry VIII. in French Flanders—into\\r\\nsomething premonitory (with a little kindness on the part of the\\r\\npremonished) of the great and long missed historical novel; still more\\r\\nfor something else. Nash, with his quick wit, seems to have been really\\r\\nthe first to perceive the capabilities of that foreign travel and\\r\\nobservation of manners which was becoming common, stripped of the\\r\\nspecial atmosphere of pilgrimage which had formerly enveloped it. Even\\r\\nhere, he had had the \"notion of the notion\" supplied to him by Lyly in\\r\\nEuphues: and a tolerably skilful advocate would not have so very much\\r\\ndifficulty in claiming the book as one of the tribe of Euphuist\\r\\npamphlets. But Jack Wilton the \"traveller\" is a little more of a person\\r\\nthan the pedagogic Euphues and the shadowy Philautus. At any rate he has\\r\\na very strong anticipation of Defoe, whose \"Cavalier\" was not improbably\\r\\nsuggested by him. But Nash has neither the patience of Defoe, nor that\\r\\nsingular originality, which accompanies in the author of Moll Flanders\\r\\na certain inability to make the most of it. The Unfortunate Traveller\\r\\nis a sort of compilation or congeries of current fabliaux, novelle,\\r\\nand facetiæ, with the introduction of famous actual persons of the\\r\\ntime, from the crowned heads of the period, through Luther and Aretine\\r\\ndownwards, to give bait and attraction. Sometimes it reminds one of a\\r\\nworking up of the Colloquies of Erasmus: three centuries earlier than\\r\\nThe Cloister and the Hearth, with much less genius than Charles\\r\\nReade\\'s, and still more without his illegitimate advantage of actual\\r\\nnovels behind him for nearly half the time. But it gives us \"disjectæ\\r\\nmembra novellæ\" rather than a novel itself: and the oftener one reads\\r\\nit the more clear one is that the time for writing novels had not yet\\r\\ncome. The materials are there; the desire to utilise—and even a faint\\r\\nvague idea of how to utilise—them is there; but the art is almost\\r\\ncompletely absent. Even regarded as an early attempt in the \"picaresque\"\\r\\nmanner, it is abortive and only half organised.\\nThe subject of the English \"Heroic\" Romance, in the wide sense, is one\\r\\nwhich has been very little dealt with. Dunlop neglected it rather\\r\\nsurprisingly, and until Professor Raleigh\\'s chapter on the subject there\\r\\nwas little of a satisfactory kind to be found about it anywhere. It\\r\\nmust, however, be admitted that the abstainers from it have been to some\\r\\nextent justified in their abstention. The subject is a curious one: and\\r\\nit has an important place in the history of the Novel, because it shows\\r\\nat once how strong was the nisus towards prose fiction and how\\r\\nsurprisingly difficult writers seem, nevertheless, to have found it to\\r\\nhit upon anything really good, much more anything really original in\\r\\nkind. For it is hardly too much to say that this century of attempt—we\\r\\ncannot call it a century of invention—from Ford to Congreve, does not\\r\\nadd a single piece of any considerable merit to the roll of English\\r\\nbooks. As for a masterpiece, there is nothing in respect of which the\\r\\nuse of such a word would not be purely ridiculous. And yet the attempts\\r\\nare interesting to the historian, and should not be uninteresting to the\\r\\nhistorical student of literature. One or two of them have a sort of\\r\\nshadowy name and place in literary history already.\\nIn tracing their progress and character, we must allow for two native\\r\\nmodels: and for three foreign sources, one ancient, two modern, of\\r\\ninfluence. The Arcadia and Euphues, the former continuously, the\\r\\nlatter by revival after an interval, exercised very great effect in the\\r\\nfirst half of the seventeenth century, during at least the earlier part\\r\\nof which the vogue of Amadis and its successors, as Englished by\\r\\nAnthony Munday and others, likewise continued. The Greek romances also\\r\\nhad much to do with the matter: for the Elizabethan translators had\\r\\nintroduced them to the vulgar, and the seventeenth century paid a good\\r\\ndeal of attention to Greek. Then, when that century itself was on its\\r\\nway, the pastoral romance of D\\'Urfé first, and the Calprenède-Scudéry\\r\\nproductions in the second place, came to give a fresh impulse, and\\r\\nsomething of a new turn. The actual translations of French and Spanish\\r\\nromance, shorter and longer, good, bad, and indifferent, are of immense\\r\\nbulk and doubtless excited imitation: but we cannot possibly deal with\\r\\nthem here. A bare list would fill a chapter. But some work of more or\\r\\nless (generally less) originality, in at least adaptation, calls for a\\r\\nlittle individual notice: and some general characterisation may be\\r\\nadded.\\nIt may be desirable to prelude the story by a reminder to the reader\\r\\nthat the general characteristics of these various sources were\\r\\n\"harlequin\" in their diversity of apparent colour. The Amadis romances\\r\\nand, indeed, all the later examples of that great kind, such as Arthur\\r\\nof Little Britain, which Berners translated, were distinguished on the\\r\\none side by a curious convention of unsmooth running of the course of\\r\\nlove, on the other sometimes by a much greater licence of morality than\\r\\ntheir predecessors, and always by a prodigality of the \"conjuror\\'s\\r\\nsupernatural\"—witches and giants and magic black and white. The Spanish\\r\\n\"picaresque\" story was pretty real but even less decent: and its French\\r\\nimitations (though not usually reaching the licence of the short tale,\\r\\nwhich clung to fabliau ways in this respect) imitated it here also.\\r\\nThe French heroic romance, on the other hand, observed the most\\r\\nscrupulous propriety in language and situation: but aggravated the\\r\\nAmadisian troubling of the course of true love, and complicated\\r\\neverything, very frequently if not invariably, by an insinuated \"key\"\\r\\ninterest of identification of the ancient personages selected as heroes\\r\\nand heroines with modern personages of quality and distinction.\\nEmanuel Ford (whom the British Museum catalogue insists on spelling\\r\\nForde and of whom very little seems to be known) published Parismus,\\r\\nPrince of Bohemia, as early as 1598. In less than a hundred years\\r\\n(1696) it had reached its fourteenth edition, and it continued to be\\r\\npopular in abridged and chap-booked form2 far into the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury. (It is sometimes called Parismus and Parismenus: the second\\r\\npart being, as very commonly in romances of the class after the Amadis\\r\\npattern, occupied largely with the adventures of the son of the hero of\\r\\nthe first.) On the whole, Parismus, though it has few pretensions to\\r\\nelegance of style, and though some delicate tastes have been shocked at\\r\\ncertain licences of incident, description, and phrase in it, is quite\\r\\nthe best of our bunch in this kind. It is, in general conception, pure\\r\\nAmadis of the later and slightly degraded type. Laurana, the heroine\\r\\n(of whom a peculiarly hideous portrait adorns the black-letter editions\\r\\nside by side with Parismus himself, who is rather a \"jolly gentleman\")\\r\\nis won with much less difficulty and in much less time than Oriana—but\\r\\nseparations and difficulties duly follow in \"desolate isles\" and the\\r\\nlike. And though Parismus himself is less of an Amadis than Amadis, the\\r\\n\"contrast of friends,\" founded by that hero and Galaor, is kept up by\\r\\nhis association with a certain Pollipus—\"a man of his hands\" if ever\\r\\nthere was one, for with them he literally wrings the neck of the\\r\\nenchantress Bellona, who has enticed him to embrace her. There is plenty\\r\\nof the book, as there always should be in its kind (between 400 and 500\\r\\nvery closely printed quarto pages), and its bulk is composed of\\r\\nproportionately plentiful fighting and love-making and of a very much\\r\\nsmaller proportion of what schoolboys irreverently call \"jaw\" than is\\r\\nusual in the class. If it were not for the black letter (which is trying\\r\\nto the eyes) I should not myself object to have no other reading than\\r\\nParismus for some holiday evenings, or even after pretty tough days of\\r\\nliterary and professional work. The Famous History of Montelion, the\\r\\nKnight of the Oracle (1633?) proclaims its Amadisian type even more\\r\\nclearly: but I have only read it in an abridged edition of the close of\\r\\nthe century. I should imagine that in extenso it was a good deal\\r\\nduller than Parismus. And of course the comparative praise which has\\r\\nbeen given to that book must be subject to the reminder that it is what\\r\\nit is—a romance of disorderly and what some people call childish\\r\\nadventure, and of the above-ticketed \"conjuror\\'s supernatural.\" If\\r\\nanybody cannot read Amadis itself, he certainly will not read\\r\\nParismus: and perhaps not everybody who can manage the original—perhaps\\r\\nnot even everybody who can manage Palmerin—could put up with Ford\\'s\\r\\ncopy. I can take this Ford as I find him: but I am not sure that I would\\r\\ngo much lower.\\nOrnatus and Artesia (1607?), on the other hand—his second or third\\r\\nbook—strikes me as owing more to Heliodorus than to Montalvo, or\\r\\nLobeira, or whoever was the author of the great romance of the last\\r\\nchivalric type. There are more intricacies in it; the heroine plays a\\r\\nrather more important part; there is even something of a nearer approach\\r\\nto modern novel-ways in this production, which reappeared at \"Grub\\r\\nStreet near the Upper Pump\" in the year 1650. Ornatus sees his mistress\\r\\nasleep and in a kind of deshabille, employs a noble go-between, Adellena\\r\\n(a queer spelling of \"Adelina\" which may be intentional), is rejected\\r\\nwith apparent indignation, of course; writes elaborate letters in vain,\\r\\nbut overhears Artesia soliloquising confession of her love for him and\\r\\ndisguises himself as a girl, Silvia. Then the villain of the piece,\\r\\nFloretus, to obtain the love of this supposed Silvia, murders a person\\r\\nof distinction and plots to poison Artesia herself. Ornatus-Silvia is\\r\\nbanished: and all sorts of adventures and disguises follow, entirely in\\r\\nthe Greek style. The book is not very long, extending only to signature\\r\\nR in a very small quarto. Except that it is much less lively and\\r\\nconsiderably less \"free,\" it reminds one rather in type of Kynaston\\'s\\r\\nverse Leoline and Sydanis. In fact the verse and prose romances of the\\r\\ntime are very closely connected: and Chamberlayne\\'s Pharonnida—far\\r\\nthe finest production of the English \"heroic\" school in prose, verse, or\\r\\ndrama—was, when the fancy for abridging set in, condensed into a tiny\\r\\nprose Eromena. But Ornatus and Artesia, if more modern, more\\r\\ndecent, and less extravagant than Parismus, is nothing like so\\r\\ninteresting to read. It is indeed quite possible that there is, if not\\r\\nin it, in its popularity, a set-back to the Arcadia itself, which had\\r\\nbeen directly followed in Lady Mary Wroth\\'s Urania (1621), and to\\r\\nwhich (by the time of the edition noted) Charles I.\\'s admiration—so\\r\\nindecently and ignobly referred to by Milton—had given a fresh\\r\\nattraction for all good anti-Puritans. That an anti-Puritan should be a\\r\\nromance-lover was almost a necessity.\\nWhen the French \"heroics\" began to appear it was only natural that they\\r\\nshould be translated, and scarcely less so that they should be imitated\\r\\nin England. For they were not far off the Arcadia pattern: and they\\r\\nwere a distinct and considerable effort to supply the appetite for\\r\\nfiction which has been dwelt upon. But except for this, and for\\r\\nfashion\\'s sake, they did not contain much that would appeal to an\\r\\nEnglish taste: and it is a little significant that one great reader of\\r\\nthem who is known to us—Mrs. Pepys—was a Frenchwoman. Indeed, save for\\r\\nthe very considerable \"pastime\" of a kind that they gave to a time, much\\r\\nof which required passing, it is difficult to understand their\\r\\nattraction for English readers. Their interminable talk never (till\\r\\nperhaps very recently) was a thing to suit our nation: and the \"key\"\\r\\ninterest strikes us at any rate as of the most languid kind. But they\\r\\nwere imitated as well as translated: and the three most famous of the\\r\\nimitations are the work of men of mark in their different ways. These\\r\\nare the Parthenissa (1654) of Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill and Earl of\\r\\nOrrery; the Aretina (1661) of Sir George Mackenzie; and the Pandion\\r\\nand Amphigeneia (1665) of \"starch Johnny\" Crowne.\\nBoyle was a strong Francophile in literature, and his not inconsiderable\\r\\ninfluence on the development of the heroic play showed it only less\\r\\ndecidedly than his imitation of the Scudéry romance. I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave read Parthenissa through: and I can say that I do not intend to\\r\\ndo so. It is enough to have read Sainte Madeleine of the Ink-Desert\\r\\nherself, without reading bad imitations of her. But I have read enough\\r\\nto know that Parthenissa would never give me anything like the\\r\\nmodified satisfaction that is given by Parismus: and after all, if a\\r\\nman will not take the trouble to finish writing his book (which Orrery\\r\\nnever did) why should his readers take the trouble even to finish\\r\\nreading what he has written? The scene is Parthia, with alternation to\\r\\nSyria, and diversions and episodes elsewhere: and though there is a\\r\\ncertain amount of fighting, the staple is quite decorous but exceedingly\\r\\ndull love-making, conducted partly in the endless dialogue (or rather\\r\\nautomatic monologue) already referred to, and partly in letters more\\r\\n\"handsome\" even than Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s, and probably a good deal\\r\\nmore sincere in their conventional way, but pretty certainly less\\r\\namusing. The original attraction indeed of this class of novel\\r\\nconsisted, and, in so far as it still exists, may be said to consist, in\\r\\nnoble sentiment, elegantly expressed. It deserved, and in a manner\\r\\ndeserves, the commendatory part of Aramis\\'s rebuke to Porthos for\\r\\nexpressing impatience with the compliments between Athos and D\\'Artagnan\\r\\nat their first and hostile rencounter.3 Otherwise there is not much to\\r\\nbe said for it. It does not indeed deserve Johnson\\'s often quoted remark\\r\\nas to Richardson (on whom when we come to him we shall have something\\r\\nmore to say in connection with these heroic romances), if any one were\\r\\nto read Parthenissa for the story he would not, unless he were a very\\r\\nimpulsive person, \"hang himself.\" He would simply, after a number of\\r\\npages varying with the individual, cease to read it.\\nThe work of the great Lord Advocate who was traduced by Covenanting\\r\\nmalice is in a certain sense more interesting: and that not merely\\r\\nbecause it is much shorter. Aretina or The Serious Romance, opens\\r\\nwith an \"apology for Romances\" generally, which goes far to justify\\r\\nDryden\\'s high opinion of Mackenzie as a critic. But it cannot be said to\\r\\nbe much—it is a little—more interesting as a story than Parthenissa,\\r\\nand it is written in a most singular lingo—not displaying the racy\\r\\nquaintness of Mackenzie\\'s elder contemporary and fellow-loyalist\\r\\nUrquhart, but a sort of Scotified and modernised Euphuism rather\\r\\nterrible to peruse. A library is \"a bibliotheck richly tapestried with\\r\\nbooks.\" Somebody possesses, or is compared to \"a cacochymick stomach,\\r\\nwhich transubstantiates the best of meats in its own malignant humour.\"\\r\\nAnd when the hero meets a pair of cannibal ruffians he confronts one and\\r\\n\"pulling out a pistol, sends from its barrel two balls clothed in\\r\\nDeath\\'s livery, and by them opens a sallyport to his soul to fly out of\\r\\nthat nasty prison.\" A certain zest may be given by these oddities, but\\r\\nit hardly lasts out more than 400 pages: and though the lives of Aretina\\r\\nand Philaretes are more simply and straightforwardly told than might be\\r\\nthought likely—though there are ingenious disguises of contemporary\\r\\npolitics, and though Mackenzie was both a wise man and a wit—it is more\\r\\ncertain than ever, when we close his book, that this is not the way of\\r\\nthe world, nor the man to walk in that way.\\nPandion and Amphigeneia is the inferior in importance of both these\\r\\nbooks. Crowne had perhaps rather more talent than it is usual to credit\\r\\nhim with, but he does not show it here. I think Sir Walter Raleigh is\\r\\nquite right in regarding the book as more or less traced over the\\r\\nArcadia: and it may be said to have all the defects of Sidney\\'s\\r\\nscheme—which, it is fair once more to observe, we do not possess in any\\r\\nform definitely settled by its author—with none of the merits of his\\r\\nornament, his execution, and his atmosphere of poetic fancy.\\nThe fact is that this heroic romance was foredoomed to inefficiency. It\\r\\nwas not a genuine kind at all: but a sort of patchwork of imitations\\r\\nof imitations—a mule which, unlike the natural animal, was itself bred,\\r\\nand bred in and in, of mules for generations back. It was true to no\\r\\ntime, to no country, to no system of manners, life, or thought. Its\\r\\noldest ancestor in one sense, though not in another—the Greek\\r\\nromance—was itself the growth of the latest and most artificial period\\r\\nof the literature to which it belonged. The pure mediæval romance of\\r\\nchivalry was another, but of this it had practically nothing left. The\\r\\nAmadis class, the late Renaissance pastorals, the immediately\\r\\npreceding or accompanying French romances of the Scudéry type, were, in\\r\\nincreasing degree, hybrid, artificial, and dead-alive. Impotence and\\r\\nsterility in every sense could but be its portion. Of the two great\\r\\nqualities of the novel—Variety and Life—it had never succeeded in\\r\\nattaining any considerable share, and it had now the merest show of\\r\\nvariety and no life at all. There is hardly anything to be said in its\\r\\nfavour, except that its vogue, as has been observed, testified to the\\r\\ncraving for prose fiction, and kept at least a simulacrum of that\\r\\nfiction before the public. How far there may be any real, though\\r\\nmetaphysical, connection between the great dramatic output of this\\r\\nseventeenth century in England and its small production in novel is a\\r\\nquestion not to be discussed here. But undoubtedly the fact of the\\r\\ncontrast is a \"document in the case,\" and one of the most important in\\r\\nits own direction; completing the testimony of the mediæval period in\\r\\nthe other (that as romance dwindled, drama grew) and leading up to that\\r\\nof the eighteenth century when drama dwindled and the novel grew. The\\r\\npractice of Afra Behn in both, and the fact that Congreve, the greatest\\r\\nEnglish dramatist of the close of the century, began with a novel and\\r\\ndeserted the style for drama, are also interesting, and combine\\r\\nthemselves very apparently with the considerations just glanced at. But\\r\\nCongreve and Afra must be postponed for a moment.\\nThe two last discussed books, with Eromena and some others, are\\r\\nposterior to the Restoration in date, but somewhat earlier in type. The\\r\\nreign of Charles II., besides the \"heroic\" romances and Bunyan, and one\\r\\nmost curious little production to be noticed presently, is properly\\r\\nrepresented in fiction by two writers, to whom, by those who like to\\r\\nmake discoveries, considerable importance has sometimes been assigned in\\r\\nthe history of the English Novel. These are Richard Head and Afra Behn,\\r\\notherwise \"the divine Astræa.\" It is, however, something of an injustice\\r\\nto class them together: for Afra was a woman of very great ability, with\\r\\na suspicion of genius, while Head was at the very best a bookmaker of\\r\\nnot quite the lowest order, though pretty near it. Of The English\\r\\nRogue (1665-1680), which earns him his place here, only the first part,\\r\\nand a certain section of the fourth, are even attributed to him by\\r\\nFrancis Kirkman, the Curll of his generation, who published the thing at\\r\\nintervals and admittedly wrote parts of it himself. It is quite openly a\\r\\npicaresque novel: and imitated not merely from the Spanish originals but\\r\\nfrom Sorel\\'s Francion, which had appeared in France some forty years\\r\\nbefore. Yet, if we compare this latter curious book with Head\\'s we shall\\r\\nsee how very far behind, even with forty years\\' advantage in time, was\\r\\nthe country which, in the next century, was practically to create the\\r\\nmodern novel. Francion is not a work of genius: and it does not\\r\\npretend to much more than the usual picaresque farrago of adventure,\\r\\nunmoral and sometimes rather cruel, but comic of a kind, strung together\\r\\nwith little art in fable, and less in character. But the author is to\\r\\nsome extent \"cumbered about serving.\" He names his characters, tries to\\r\\ngive them some vague personality, furnishes them with some roughly and\\r\\nsketchily painted scenery, and gives us not merely told tales, but\\r\\noccasionally something distantly resembling conversation. Head takes no\\r\\ntrouble of this kind: and Kirkman does not seem to think that any such\\r\\nthing is required of him. Very few of the characters of The English\\r\\nRogue have so much as a name to their backs: they are \"a prentice,\" \"a\\r\\nmaster,\" \"a mistress,\" \"a servant,\" \"a daughter,\" \"a tapster,\" etc. They\\r\\nare invested with hardly the slightest individuality: the very hero is a\\r\\nscoundrel as characterless as he is nameless:4 he is the mere thread\\r\\nwhich keeps the beads of the story together after a fashion. These beads\\r\\nthemselves, moreover, are only the old anecdotes of \"coney-catching,\"\\r\\nover-reaching, and worse, which had separately filled a thousand\\r\\nfabliaux, novelle, \"jests,\" and so forth: and which are now flung\\r\\ntogether in gross, chiefly by the excessively clumsy and unimaginative\\r\\nexpedient of making the personages tell long strings of them as their\\r\\nown experience. When anything more is wanted, accounts of the manners of\\r\\nforeign countries, taken from \"voyage-and-travel\" books; of the tricks\\r\\nof particular trades (as here of piratical book-selling); of anything\\r\\nand everything that the writer\\'s dull fancy can think of, are foisted\\r\\nin. The thing is in four volumes, and it seems that a fifth was intended\\r\\nas a close: but there is no particular reason why it should not have\\r\\nextended to forty or fifty, nay to four or five hundred. It could have\\r\\nhad no real end, just as it has no real beginning or middle.\\nOne other point deserves notice. The tone of the Spanish and French\\r\\npicaresque novel had never been high: but it is curiously degraded in\\r\\nthis English example. Furetière honestly called his book Roman\\r\\nBourgeois. Head might have called his, if he had written in French,\\r\\nRoman Canaille. Not merely the sentiments but the very outward\\r\\ntrappings and accidents of gentility are banished from the book. Yet we\\r\\ndo not get any real reality in compensation. Head is no Defoe: he can\\r\\ngive us the company that Colonel Jack kept in his youth and Moll\\r\\nFlanders in her middle age: but he makes not the slightest attempt to\\r\\ngive us Moll or Jack, or even Moll\\'s or Jack\\'s habit, environment,\\r\\nnovel-furniture of any kind whatsoever. The receipt to make The English\\r\\nRogue is simply this: \"Take from two to three dozen Elizabethan\\r\\npamphlets of different kinds, but principally of the \\'coney-catching\\'\\r\\nvariety, and string them together by making a batch of shadowy\\r\\npersonages tell them to each other when they are not acting in them.\"\\r\\nExcept in a dim sort of idea that a novel should have some bulk and\\r\\nsubstance, it is difficult to see any advance whatever in this\\r\\nmuck-heap—which the present writer, having had to read it a second time\\r\\nfor the present purpose, most heartily hopes to be able to leave\\r\\nhenceforth undisturbed on his shelves.\\nNot in this fashion must the illustrious Afra be spoken of. It is true\\r\\nthat—since it ceased to be the fashion merely to dismiss her with a\\r\\n\"fie-fie!\" which her prose work, at any rate, by no means merits—there\\r\\nhas sometimes been a tendency rather to overdo praise of her, not merely\\r\\nin reference to her lyrics, some of which can never be praised too\\r\\nhighly, but in reference to these novels. Oroonoko or The Royal\\r\\nSlave, with its celebration of the virtues of a noble negro and his\\r\\nlove for his Imoinda, and his brutal ill-treatment and death by torture\\r\\nat the hands of white murderers, undoubtedly took the fancy of the\\r\\npublic. But to see at once Rousseau and Byron in it, Chateaubriand and\\r\\nWilberforce and I know not what else, is rather in the \"lunatic, lover,\\r\\nand poet\" order of vision. Even Head and Kirkman, as we have observed,\\r\\nhad perceived the advantage of foreign scenery and travel to vary their\\r\\nmatter; Afra had herself been in Guiana; and, as she was of a very\\r\\ninflammable disposition, it is quite possible that some Indian Othello\\r\\nhad caught her fresh imagination. On the other hand, there was the\\r\\nheroic romance, with all its sighs and flames, still the rage: and a\\r\\nmuch less nimble intellect than Afra\\'s, with a much less cosmopolitan\\r\\nexperience, might easily see the use of transposing it into a new key.\\r\\nStill, there is no doubt that The Royal Slave and even its companions\\r\\nare far above the dull, dirty, and never more than half alive stuff of\\r\\nThe English Rogue. Oroonoko is a story, not a pamphlet or a mere\\r\\n\"coney-catching\" jest. To say that it wants either contraction or\\r\\nexpansion; less \"talk about it\" and more actual conversation; a stronger\\r\\nprojection of character and other things; is merely to say that it is an\\r\\nexperiment in the infancy of the novel, not a following out of secrets\\r\\nalready divulged. It certainly is the first prose story in English which\\r\\ncan be ranked with things that already existed in foreign literatures.\\r\\nNor is it the only one of the batch in which advance is seen. \"The King\\r\\nof Bantam,\" for instance, is the account of an \"extravagant,\" though not\\r\\nquite a fool, who is \"coney-catched\" in the old manner. But it opens in\\r\\na fashion very different indeed from the old manner. \"This money is\\r\\ncertainly a most devilish thing! I\\'m sure the want of it had been like\\r\\nto ruin my dear Philibella!\" and the succeeding adventures are pretty\\r\\nfreshly told. The trick of headlong overture was a favourite with Afra.\\r\\n\"The Adventure of the Black Lady\" begins, \"About the beginning of last\\r\\nJune, as near as I can remember, Bellamira came to town from Hampshire.\"\\r\\nIt is a trick of course: and here probably borrowed from the French: but\\r\\nthe line which separates trick from artistic device is an exceedingly\\r\\nnarrow and winding one. At any rate, this plunging into the middle of\\r\\nthings wakes up the reader\\'s attention, and does not permit him to doze.\\r\\n\"The Lucky Mistake,\" on the other hand, opens with a little landscape,\\r\\n\"The river Loire has on its delightful banks, etc.\" \"The Fair Jilt,\" a\\r\\nBandello-like story, begins with an exaltation of Love: and so on. Now\\r\\nthese things, though they may seem matters of course to the mere modern\\r\\nreader, were not matters of course then. Afra very likely imitated; her\\r\\nworks have never been critically edited; and have not served as field\\r\\nfor much origin-hunting. But whether she followed others or not, she led\\r\\nher own division. All these things and others are signs of an awakened\\r\\nconscience—of a sense of the fact that fiction, to be literature, must\\r\\nbe something more than the relation of a bare fact, tragic, comic, or\\r\\nneutral—that the novelist is a cook, and must prepare and serve his\\r\\nmaterials with a sauce as much his own as possible, of plot,\\r\\narrangement, character-drawing, scenery, conversation, reflection, and\\r\\nwhat not. That conversation itself—the subtlest instrument of all and\\r\\nthe most effective for constructing character—is so little developed,\\r\\ncan only, I think, be accounted for by supposing Afra and others to be\\r\\nunder the not unnatural mistake that conversation especially belonged to\\r\\nthe drama, which was still the most popular form of literature, and in\\r\\nwhich she herself was a copious practitioner. But this mistake was not\\r\\nlong to prevail: and it had no effect on that great contemporary of hers\\r\\nwho would, it is to be feared, have used the harshest language\\r\\nrespecting her, and to whom we now come.\\nIt is impossible to share, and not very easy even to understand, the\\r\\nscruples of those who would not admit John Bunyan to a place in the\\r\\nhierarchy and the pedigree of the English novel, or would at best grant\\r\\nhim an outside position in relation to it. Their exquisite reasons, so\\r\\nfar as one can discern them, appear to be (or to concern) the facts that\\r\\nThe Pilgrim\\'s Progress and The Holy War are religious, and that they\\r\\nare allegories.5 It may be humbly suggested that by applying the\\r\\ndouble rule to verse we can exclude Paradise Lost and the Faerie\\r\\nQueene from the succession of English Poetry, whereby no doubt we\\r\\nshall be finely holden in understanding the same: while it is by no\\r\\nmeans certain that, if the exclusion of allegory be pushed home, we must\\r\\nnot cancel Don Quixote from the list of the world\\'s novels. Even in\\r\\nprose, to speak plainly, the hesitation—unless it comes from the\\r\\nfoolish dislike to things religious, as such, which has been the bigotry\\r\\nof the last generation or two—comes from the almost equally foolish\\r\\ndetermination to draw up arbitrary laws of literary kind. Discarding\\r\\nprejudice and punctilio, every one must surely see that, in diminishing\\r\\nmeasure, even The Holy War is a novel, and that The Pilgrim\\'s\\r\\nProgress has every one of the four requisites—plot, character,\\r\\ndescription, and dialogue—while one of these requisites—character with\\r\\nits accessory manners—is further developed in the History of Mr.\\r\\nBadman after a fashion for which we shall look vainly in any division\\r\\nof European literature (except drama) before it. This latter fact has\\r\\nindeed obtained a fair amount of recognition since Mr. Froude drew the\\r\\nattention of the general reader to it in his book on Bunyan, in the\\r\\n\"English Men of Letters\" series, five-and-twenty years ago: but it must\\r\\nhave struck careful readers of the great tinker\\'s minor works long\\r\\nbefore. Indeed there are very good internal reasons for thinking that no\\r\\nless a person than Thackeray must have known Mr. Badman. This\\r\\nwonderful little sketch, however—the related history of a man who is an\\r\\nutter rascal both in family and commercial relations, but preserves his\\r\\nreputation intact and does not even experience any deathbed\\r\\nrepentance—is rather an unconscious study for a character in a novel—a\\r\\nsketch of a bourgeois Barnes Newcome—than anything more. It has the\\r\\nold drawback of being narrated, not acted or spoken at first hand: and\\r\\nso, though it is in a sense Fielding at nearly his best, more than half\\r\\na century before Fielding attempted Joseph Andrews, no more need be\\r\\nsaid of it. So, too, the religious element and the allegory are too\\r\\nprominent in The Holy War—the novelist\\'s desk is made too much of a\\r\\npulpit in large parts of it. Other parts, concerning the inhabitants of\\r\\nMansoul and their private affairs, are domestic novel-writing of nearly\\r\\nthe pure kind: and if The Pilgrim\\'s Progress did not exist, it would\\r\\nbe worth while to pick them out and discuss them. But, as it most\\r\\nfortunately does exist, this is not needful.\\nThe only fault with the novel-character of the greater book which might\\r\\npossibly be found by a critic who did not let the allegory bite him, and\\r\\nwas not frightened by the religion, is that there is next to no love\\r\\nelement in it, though there are wedding bells. Mercy is indeed quite\\r\\nnice enough for a heroine: but Bunyan might have bestowed her better\\r\\nthan on a young gentleman so very young that he had not long before made\\r\\nhimself (no doubt allegorically) ill with unripe and unwholesome fruit.\\r\\nBut if he had done so, the suspicions of his brethren—they were acute\\r\\nenough as it was not to mistake the character of the book, whatever\\r\\nmodern critics may do—would have been even more unallayable. And, as it\\r\\nis, the \"alluring countenance\" does shed not a little grace upon the\\r\\nstory, or at least upon the Second Part: while the intenser character of\\r\\nthe First hardly requires this. Any other lack is, to the present\\r\\nwriter, imperceptible. The romance interest of quest, adventure,\\r\\nachievement, is present to the fullest degree: and what is sometimes\\r\\ncalled the pure novel interest of character and conversation is present\\r\\nin a degree not lower. It must be accepted as a great blessing, even by\\r\\nthose who regard Puritanism as an almost unmitigated curse, that its\\r\\nprinciples forbade Bunyan to think of choosing the profane and\\r\\nabominable stage-play as the form of his creation. We had had our fill\\r\\nof good plays, and were beginning to drink of that which was worse:\\r\\nwhile we had no good novels and wanted them. Of course the large amount\\r\\nof actual \"Tig and Tirry\" dialogue (as Dr. Johnson would say) is\\r\\nprobably one of the things which have made precisians shy of accepting\\r\\nthe Progress for what it really is. But we must remember that this\\r\\nencroachment on the dramatic province was exactly what was wanted to\\r\\nremove the reproach of fiction. The inability to put actual conversation\\r\\nof a lively kind in the mouths of personages has been indicated as one\\r\\nof the great defects of the novel up to this time. Except Cervantes, it\\r\\nis difficult to think of any novelist who had shown himself able to\\r\\nsupply the want. Bunyan can do it as few have done it even since his\\r\\ntime. The famous dialogue of Christian and By-ends is only the best—if\\r\\nit is the best—of scores nearly or quite as good. The curious\\r\\nintellectual flaccidity of the present day seems to be \"put off\" by the\\r\\n\"ticket\" names; but no one who has the true literary sense cares for\\r\\nthese one way or another, or is more disturbed by them than if they were\\r\\nWilkins and Jones. Just as Coleridge observed that to enjoy some kinds\\r\\nof poetry you must suspend disbelief, so, with mere literary fashions,\\r\\nyou must suspend disagreement. We should not call By-ends By-ends now:\\r\\nand whether we should do better or worse nobody, as Plato says, knows\\r\\nbut the Deity. But the best of us would be hard put to it to make\\r\\nBy-ends reveal his By-endishness more perfectly than he does by his\\r\\nconversation, and without any ticket-name at all.\\nNot less remarkable, and only a little less new, is the vividness and\\r\\nsufficiency of the scene painting and setting. It has been said that\\r\\nthe great novelists not only provide us with a world of friends more\\r\\nreal and enjoyable than the actual folk we know, but also with a world\\r\\nfor those friends to live in, more real and far more enjoyable than the\\r\\nworld in which we ourselves sojourn. And this is well seen of Christian.\\r\\nThe Slough of Despond and the terrible overhanging hill; the gateway and\\r\\nthe Interpreter\\'s House and the House Beautiful; the ups and downs of\\r\\nthe road, and the arbours and the giants\\' dens: Beulah and the\\r\\nDelectable Mountains:—one knows them as one knows the country that one\\r\\nhas walked over, and perhaps even better. There is no description for\\r\\ndescription\\'s sake: yet nothing is wanting of the descriptive kind.\\nYet all these things are—as they should be—only subsidiary to the main\\r\\ninterest of the Pilgrimage itself. Once more, one may fear that it is no\\r\\ngood sign of the wits of the age that readers should be unable to\\r\\ndiscard familiarity with the argument of the story. It is the way in\\r\\nwhich that argument is worked out and illustrated that is the thing. I\\r\\nhave never myself, since I became thoroughly acquainted with Lydgate\\'s\\r\\nEnglishing of Deguilevile\\'s Pilgrimage of the Soul of Man, had any\\r\\ndoubt that—in some way or other, direct or indirect, at tenth or\\r\\ntwentieth hand perhaps—Bunyan was acquainted with it: but this is of no\\r\\nimportance. He might undoubtedly have got all his materials straight out\\r\\nof the Bible. But his working of them up is all his own, and is\\r\\nwonderful. Here, to begin with, is the marvel not merely of a\\r\\ncontinuation which is not a falling off, but of a repetition of the same\\r\\ngeneral scheme with different but closely connected personages, which is\\r\\nentirely free from monotony. One is so accustomed to the facts that\\r\\nperhaps it hardly strikes one at first how extraordinarily audacious the\\r\\nattempt is: nay, the very success of it may blind all but critics to\\r\\nthe difficulty. It is no wonder that people tried further continuations\\r\\nand further complications: still less wonder that they utterly failed.\\r\\nProbably even Bunyan himself could not have \"done it a third time.\" But\\r\\nhe did it these twice with such vividness of figure and action; such\\r\\ncompleteness of fable; such sufficiency of behaviour and of speech as\\r\\nhave scarcely ever been equalled. As ideal as Spenser, as real as Defoe:\\r\\nsuch is Bunyan. And he shows this realism and this idealism in a prose\\r\\nnarrative, bringing the thoughts and actions and characters and speech\\r\\nof fictitious human beings before his readers—for their inspection\\r\\nperhaps; for their delight certainly. If this is not the being and the\\r\\ndoing of a novelist this deponent very humbly declareth that he knoweth\\r\\nnot what the being and the doing of a novelist are.\\nWe must now turn to two small but noteworthy attempts at the kind, which\\r\\nhave been referred to above.\\nIn 1668 there appeared a very curious little book (entitled at great\\r\\nlength after the manner of the times, but more shortly called The Isle\\r\\nof Pines), which is important in the literary ancestry of Defoe and\\r\\nSwift and not unimportant in itself. Its author was Henry Neville, of\\r\\nthe Nevilles of Billingbeare, son of one Sir Henry and grandson of\\r\\nanother, the grandfather having been of some mark in diplomacy and\\r\\ncourtiership in late Elizabethan and early Jacobean times. The grandson\\r\\nhad had a life of some stir earlier. Born in 1620, and educated at\\r\\nMerton and University Colleges, he had left Oxford without a degree, had\\r\\ntaken the Parliamentary side, but as a rigid Republican and\\r\\nanti-Cromwellite; had been a member of the Rota, and after the\\r\\nRestoration had been arrested in 1663 for supposed treasonable\\r\\npractices, but escaped serious punishment. He lived quietly for more\\r\\nthan thirty years longer and died in 1694. Besides The Isle of Pines\\r\\nhe wrote satirical tracts (the Parliament of Ladies being the best\\r\\nknown), translated Machiavelli, and was evidently a man of parts,\\r\\nthough, like his friend Harrington, something of a \"crank.\" He seems\\r\\nalso to have been, as some others of the extremer Puritans certainly\\r\\nwere, pretty loose in his construction of moral laws.\\nThe Isle is a very short book of thirty-one quarto pages: but there is\\r\\na good deal in it, and it must have been very carefully written. A\\r\\ncertain Cornelius van Sloetten writes, \"supported by letters from\\r\\nAmsterdam,\" how a Dutch ship, driven far out of reckoning in the\\r\\nSouthern Ocean, comes to a \"fourth island, near Terra Australis\\r\\nIncognita,\" which is inhabited by white people, speaking English, but\\r\\nmostly naked. The headman is a certain William Pine, whose grandfather,\\r\\nGeorge, has left a written account of the origin of the community. This\\r\\nrelates how George was wrecked on the island, the ship perishing \"with\\r\\nman and mouse,\" except himself, his master\\'s daughter, two white\\r\\nmaidservants, and a negro girl. The island proves pleasant and\\r\\nhabitable: and George, to prevent unfairness and ill-feeling, unites\\r\\nhimself to all his female companions, the quintet living in perfect\\r\\nharmony. Thirty-seven children result: and these at first necessarily\\r\\nintermarry; but after this first generation, a rule is made that\\r\\nbrothers and sisters may not unite—the descendants of the four original\\r\\nwives forming clans who may marry into the others but not into their\\r\\nown. A wider legal code of fair stringency is arranged, with the\\r\\nsanction of capital and other punishments: and things go so well that\\r\\nthe patriarch musters a tribe of 565 persons by the time he is sixty,\\r\\nand of 1789 twenty years later, when he departs this life, piously\\r\\npraying God \"to multiply them and send them the true report of the\\r\\ngospel.\" The multiplication has duly taken place, and there is something\\r\\nlike a civil war while the Dutch are there; but they interfere with\\r\\nfire-arms to restore order, and leave all well. The writer\\'s cunning is\\r\\nshown by the fact that he does not stop abruptly: but finishes off with\\r\\nsome subsequent and quite verisimilar experiences of the Dutch ship.\\r\\nThe book does not appear to have had a very great popularity in England,\\r\\nthough it was reprinted and abridged at least once, pretty shortly. But\\r\\nit was very popular abroad, was translated into three or four languages,\\r\\nand was apparently taken as a genuine account.\\nNeville\\'s art is in fact not inconsiderable. Earlier voyages and travels\\r\\nof course supplied him with his technical and geographical details: and\\r\\nthe codification of the Isle of Pines suggests the Bacon-Harrington\\r\\ntradition. But he has got the vividness and realism which have usually\\r\\nbeen lacking before: and though some of his details are pretty \"free\" it\\r\\nis by no means only through such things that these qualities are\\r\\nsecured. To Cyrano de Bergerac he bears no likeness at all. In fact,\\r\\nthough Neville was a satirist, satire does not seem to have been in\\r\\nany way his object here. Whatever that object may have been, he has\\r\\ncertainly struck, by accident or not, on the secret of producing an\\r\\ninteresting account by ingeniously multiplied and adjusted detail.\\r\\nMoreover, as there is no conversation, the book stands—accidentally\\r\\nthis time almost without doubt—at the opposite pole from the\\r\\ntalk-deluged romances of the Scudéry type. Whether Defoe actually knew\\r\\nit or not matters exceedingly little: that something of his method, and\\r\\nin a manner the subject of his first and most famous novel, are here\\r\\nbefore him, seems quite indisputable. Perhaps not the least piquant\\r\\nthing to do with The Isle of Pines is to contrast it with Oceana. Of\\r\\ncourse the contrast is unfair: nearly all contrasts are. But there is\\r\\nactually, as has been pointed out, a slight contact between the work of\\r\\nthe two friends: and their complete difference in every other respect\\r\\nmakes this more curiously apparent. And another odd thing is that\\r\\nNeville—\"Rota\"-republican as he was—should have adopted patriarchal\\r\\n(one can hardly say legitimate) government here.\\nCongreve\\'s Incognita (1692), the last seventeenth-century novel that\\r\\nrequires special notice, belongs much more to the class of Afra\\'s tales\\r\\nthan to that of the heroic romances. It is a short story of seventy-five\\r\\nsmall pages only and of the Italian-Spanish imbroglio type. The friends\\r\\nAurelian and Hippolito take each other\\'s names for certain purposes, and\\r\\ntheir beloveds, \"Incognita,\" Juliana and Leonora, are perplexed\\r\\naccordingly: while family feuds, letter assignations at a convent where\\r\\nthe name of the convent unluckily happens to be torn off, and other\\r\\nstock ingredients of the kind are freely used. Most writers have either\\r\\nsaid nothing about the book or have given it scanty praise; with the\\r\\nexception, Sir Walter Raleigh, I confess that I cannot here agree. Being\\r\\nCongreve\\'s it could not be quite without flashes of wit, but they do not\\r\\nappear to me to be either very numerous or very brilliant; the plot,\\r\\nsuch as it is, is a plot of drama rather than of fiction; and there is\\r\\nno character that I can see. It is in fact only one of a vast multitude\\r\\nof similar stories, not merely in the two languages just referred to,\\r\\nbut in French, which were but to show that the time of the novel was not\\r\\nyet come, even when the time of this century was all but over.\\nIt was quite over, and the first two decades of the next were all but\\r\\nover too, before the way was, to any important extent, further explored:\\r\\nbut important assistance in the exploration was given at the beginning\\r\\nof the second of these decades. The history of the question of the\\r\\nrelations of the Addison-Steele periodical, and especially of the\\r\\n\"Coverley Papers,\" to the novel is both instructive and amusing to those\\r\\nwho have come to appreciate the humours of literary things. It would\\r\\nprobably have shocked the more orthodox admirers of the Spectator,\\r\\nduring the eighteenth century, to have any such connection or relation\\r\\nso much as hinted. But when people began to consider literature and\\r\\nliterary history in a better arranged perspective, the fact that there\\r\\nis such a connection or relation must have been soon perceived. It has\\r\\nbecome comparatively a commonplace: and now the third stage—that in\\r\\nwhich people become uneasy and suspicious of the commonplace and obvious\\r\\nand try to turn it topsy-turvy—has begun.\\nIt is of course undeniable that the \"Coverley Papers,\" as they stand,\\r\\nare not a novel, even on the loosest conception and construction of the\\r\\nterm. There is no plot; some of what should be the most important\\r\\ncharacters are merely heard of, not seen; and the various scenes have no\\r\\nsort of connection, except that the same persons figure in them. But\\r\\nthese undeniable facts do not interfere with two other facts, equally\\r\\nundeniable and much more important. The first is that the papers could\\r\\nbe turned into a novel with hardly any important alteration, and with\\r\\nonly quantum suff. of addition and completion. \"The widow\" is there in\\r\\nthe background ready to be produced and made a heroine; many of the\\r\\nincidents are told novel-fashion already, and more could be translated\\r\\ninto that fashion by the veriest tyro at novel writing who has written\\r\\nat any time during the last one hundred and fifty years. The personages\\r\\nof the club have merely to step down and out; the scenes to be\\r\\nconnected, amplified, and multiplied; the conversation to undergo the\\r\\nsame process.\\nBut the second point is of greater importance still. Not only could the\\r\\n\"Coverley Papers,\" be made into a novel without the slightest\\r\\ndifficulty, and by a process much of which would be simple enlargement\\r\\nof material; but they already possess, in a fashion which requires no\\r\\nalteration at all, many of the features of the novel, far more\\r\\nsuccessfully hit off than had ever been done before in the novel itself.\\r\\nThis is true of the dialogue to no small extent, and of the description\\r\\neven more: but it is truest of all of the characters. Except Bunyan,\\r\\nnobody in prose fiction had ever made personages so thoroughly spirited\\r\\nas Sir Roger and even the two Wills, Honeycomb and Wimble; while here\\r\\nthere was \"no allaying Thames\" in the shape of allegory, little\\r\\nmoralising and that of a kind quite human, a plentiful setting of\\r\\nordinary and familiar scene, and a more plentiful and exact adjustment\\r\\nof ordinary and familiar manners. It is true that Addison, partly owing\\r\\nto the undercurrent of his satirical humour (Steele succeeds rather\\r\\nbetter here), has not attained the astonishing verisimilitude of the\\r\\nwriter to whom we shall come next and last but one in this chapter. His\\r\\ncharacters are perfectly natural, but we know, all the while, that they\\r\\nare works of art. But in most of the points just mentioned he has\\r\\nexactly the tricks of the novelist\\'s art that Defoe has not. The smaller\\r\\ntales in the Tatler and its followers undoubtedly did something to\\r\\nremove the reproach from prose fiction, and more to sharpen the appetite\\r\\nfor it. But they were nothing new: the short tale being of unknown\\r\\nantiquity. The \"Coverley Papers\" were new and did much more. This new\\r\\nkind of treatment may not have suggested beforehand (it is not certain\\r\\nthat it did not) the extensive novel of character and manners—the play\\r\\nlengthened, bodied more strongly, and turned into narrative form. But\\r\\nthe process was there; the instances of it were highly reputed and\\r\\nwidely known. It must in almost any case have gone hard but a further\\r\\nstep still would be taken. It was actually taken by the person who had\\r\\nsuggested the periodical essay itself.\\nMuch has been written about Defoe, but, curiously enough, the least part\\r\\nof what has been written about him has concerned the very part of him\\r\\nthat is read—his novels. Nay, occasional eccentrics, and not only\\r\\nthese, have shown a sort of disposition to belittle him as a novelist:\\r\\nindeed the stock description of Richardson as the Father of the English\\r\\nNovel almost pointedly rules Defoe out. Yet further, the most adequate\\r\\nand intelligent appreciation of his novel work itself has too often been\\r\\nmainly confined to what is no doubt a subject of exceeding interest—the\\r\\nspecial means by which he secures the attention, and procures the\\r\\ndelight, of his readers. We shall have to deal with this too. But the\\r\\npoint to which it is wished to draw special attention now is different,\\r\\nand we may reach it best by the ordinary \"statement of case.\"\\nAlmost everybody who knows any literary history, knows that the book by\\r\\nwhich, after thirty or forty years of restless publication in all sorts\\r\\nof prose and rhyme, Defoe niched himself immovably in English\\r\\nliterature, was a new departure by almost an old man. He was all but, if\\r\\nnot quite, sixty when Robinson Crusoe appeared: and a very few\\r\\nfollowing years saw the appearance of his pretty voluminous \"minor\"\\r\\nnovels. The subject of the first every one knows without limitation: it\\r\\nis not so certain, though vigorous efforts have been made to popularise\\r\\nthe others, that even their subjects are clearly known to many people.\\r\\nCaptain Singleton (1720), Moll Flanders, and Colonel Jack (both\\r\\n1722) are picaresque romances with tolerably sordid heroes and heroines,\\r\\nbut with the style entirely rejuvenated by Defoe\\'s secret. Roxana\\r\\n(1724), a very puzzling book which is perhaps not entirely his writing,\\r\\nis of the same general class: the Voyage round the World (1725), the\\r\\nleast interesting, but not uninteresting, is exactly what its title\\r\\nimports,—in other words, the \"stuffing\" of the Robinson pie without\\r\\nthe game. The Memoirs of a Cavalier (1720) approach the historical\\r\\nnovel (or at least the similar \"stuffing\" of that) and have raised\\r\\ncurious and probably insoluble questions as to whether they are\\r\\ninventions at all—questions intimately connected with that general one\\r\\nreferred to above. One or two minor things are sometimes added to the\\r\\nlist: but they require no special notice. The seven books just mentioned\\r\\nare Defoe\\'s contribution to the English novel. Let us consider the\\r\\nquality of this contribution first—and then the means used to attain\\r\\nit.\\nTheir novel-quality (which, as has been hinted, has not been claimed so\\r\\nloudly or so steadily as it should have been for Defoe) is the quality\\r\\nof Story-Interest—and this, one dares say, he not only infused for the\\r\\nfirst time in full dose, but practically introduced into the English\\r\\nnovel, putting the best of the old mediæval romances aside and also\\r\\nputting aside The Pilgrim\\'s Progress, which is not likely to have been\\r\\nwithout influence on himself. It may be said, \"Oh! but the Amadis\\r\\nromances, and the Elizabethan novels, and the \\'heroics\\' must have\\r\\ninterested or they would not have been read.\" This looks plausible, but\\r\\nis a mistake. Few people who have not studied the history of criticism\\r\\nknow the respectable reluctance to be pleased with literature which\\r\\ndistinguished mankind till very recent times; and which in fact kept the\\r\\nnovel back or was itself maintained by the absence of the novel. In life\\r\\npeople pleased themselves irregularly enough: in literature they could\\r\\nnot get out of the idea that they ought to be instructed, that it was\\r\\nenough to be instructed, and that it was discreditable to ask for more.\\r\\nEven the poet was allowed to delight grudgingly and at his peril; was\\r\\nsuspected because he did delight, and had to pay a sort of heavy\\r\\nlicence-duty for it, in the shape of concomitant instruction to others\\r\\nand good behaviour in himself. In fact he was a publican who was bound\\r\\nto serve stodgy food as well as exhilarating drink.\\nIt is impossible to doubt that people were similarly affected to the\\r\\nfiction of the Renaissance and the seventeenth century, at least in its\\r\\nlonger examples—for the smaller novelle could amuse in their own way\\r\\nsometimes, though they could hardly absorb. It is equally impossible to\\r\\nimagine any one being \"enthralled\" by Euphues. Admiration, of a kind,\\r\\nmust have been the only passion excited by it. In the Arcadia there is\\r\\na certain charm, but it belongs to the inset verse—to the almost\\r\\nSpenserian visionariness of parts—to the gracious lulling atmosphere\\r\\nof the whole. If it had been published in three volumes, one cannot\\r\\nimagine the most enthusiastic novel-reader knocking up a friend late at\\r\\nnight for volume two or volume three. I have said that I can read\\r\\nParismus for pastime: but the pastime that it provides is certainly\\r\\nnot over-stimulating, and the mild stimulant becomes unsweetened and\\r\\nunlemoned barley-water in books of the Parthenissa class. If with them\\r\\nconversing one forgets all time, it must be by the influence of the\\r\\nkind go-between Sleep. We know, of course, that their contemporaries did\\r\\nnot go to sleep over them: but it was because they felt that they were\\r\\nbeing done good to—that they were in the height of polite society—that\\r\\ntheir manners were being softened and not allowed to be gross. The time,\\r\\nin its blunt way, was fond of contrasting the attractions of a mistress\\r\\non one side and \"a friend and a bottle\" on the other. That a novel could\\r\\nenter into competition with either or both, as an interesting and even\\r\\nexciting means of passing the time, would have entered very few heads at\\r\\nall and have been contemptuously dismissed from most of those that it\\r\\ndid enter.\\nAddison and Steele in the \"Coverley Papers\" had shown the way to\\r\\nconstruct this new spell: Defoe actually constructed it. It may be that\\r\\nsome may question whether the word \"exciting\" applies exactly to his\\r\\nstories. But this is logomachy: and in fact a well-willing reader can\\r\\nget very fairly excited while the Cavalier is escaping after Marston\\r\\nMoor; while it is doubtful whether the savages have really come and what\\r\\nwill be the event; while it is again doubtful whether Moll is caught or\\r\\nnot; or what has become of those gains of the boy Jack, which can hardly\\r\\nbe called ill-gotten because there is such a perfect unconsciousness of\\r\\nill on the part of the getter. At any rate, if such a reader cannot feel\\r\\nexcitement here, he would utterly stagnate in any previous novel.\\nIn presence of this superior—this emphatically and doubly\\r\\n\"novel\"—interest, all other things become comparatively unimportant.\\r\\nThe relations of Robinson Crusoe to Selkirk\\'s experiences and to one\\r\\nor two other books (especially the already mentioned Isle of Pines)\\r\\nmay not unfitly employ the literary historian who chooses to occupy\\r\\nhimself with them. The allegory which Defoe alleges in it, and which\\r\\nsome biographers have endeavoured to work out, cannot, I suppose, be\\r\\nabsolutely pooh-poohed, but presents no attractions whatever to the\\r\\npresent writer. Whether the Cavalier is pure fiction, or partly\\r\\nembroidered fact, is a somewhat interesting question, if only because\\r\\nit seems to be impossible to find out the answer: and the same may be\\r\\nsaid of the not impossible (indeed almost more than probable) Portuguese\\r\\nmaps and documents at the back of Captain Singleton. To disembroil the\\r\\nchronological muddle of Roxana, and follow out the tangles of the\\r\\nhide-and-seek of that most unpleasant \"lady of pleasure\" and her\\r\\ndaughter, may suit some. But, apart from all these things, there abides\\r\\nthe fact that you can read the books—read them again and again—enjoy\\r\\nthem most keenly at first and hardly less keenly afterwards, however\\r\\noften you repeat the reading.\\nAs has been partly said, the means by which this effect is achieved, and\\r\\nalso the means by which it is not, are almost equally remarkable. The\\r\\nFour Elements of the novel are sometimes, and not incorrectly, said to\\r\\nbe Plot, Character, Description, and Dialogue—Style, which some would\\r\\nmake a fifth, being rather a characteristic in another order of\\r\\ndivision. It is curious that Defoe is rebellious or evasive under any\\r\\nanalysis of this kind. His plots are of the \"strong\" order—the events\\r\\nsucceed each other and are fairly connected, but do not compose a\\r\\nhistory so much as a chronicle. In character, despite his intense\\r\\nverisimilitude, he is not very individual. Robinson himself, Moll, Jack,\\r\\nWilliam the Quaker in Singleton, even Roxana the cold-blooded and\\r\\ncovetous courtesan, cannot be said not to be real—they and almost every\\r\\none of the minorities are an immense advance on the colourless and\\r\\nbloodless ticketed puppets of the Middle Fiction. But they still want\\r\\nsomething—the snap of the fingers of the artist. Moll is perhaps the\\r\\nmost real of all of them and yet one has no flash-sights of her\\r\\nbeing—never sees her standing out against soft blue sky or\\r\\nthunder-cloud as one sees the great characters of fiction; never hears\\r\\nher steps winding and recognises her gesture as one does theirs.\\nSo again his description is sufficient: and the enumerative\\r\\nparticularity of it is even great part of the secret de Polichinelle\\r\\nto which we are coming. But it is far from elaborate in any other way\\r\\nand has hardly the least decoration or poetical quality. Well as we know\\r\\nCrusoe\\'s Island the actual scenery of it is not half so much impressed\\r\\nas that even, for instance, of Masterman Ready\\'s—it is either of the\\r\\nhuman figures—Crusoe\\'s own grotesque bedizenment, the savages, Friday,\\r\\nthe Spaniards, Will Atkins—or of the works of man—the stockade, the\\r\\nboat, and the rest—that we think. A little play is made with Jack\\'s\\r\\nglass-house squalor and Roxana\\'s magnificence de mauvais lieu, but not\\r\\nmuch: the gold-dust and deserts of Singleton are a necessary part of\\r\\nthe \"business,\" but nothing more. Moll Flanders—in some respects the\\r\\ngreatest of all his books—has the bareness of an Elizabethan stage in\\r\\nscenery and properties—it is much if Greenfield spares us a table or a\\r\\nbed to furnish it.\\nOf Dialogue Defoe is specially fond—even making his personages\\r\\nsoliloquise in this after a fashion—and it plays a very important part\\r\\nin \"the secret:\" yet it can hardly be classed very high as dialogue.\\r\\nAnd this is at least partly due to the strange drab shapelessness of\\r\\nhis style, which never takes on any brilliant colour, or quaint\\r\\nindividual form.\\nYet it is very questionable whether any other style would have suited\\r\\nthe method so well, or would even have suited it at all. For this\\r\\nmethod—to leave off hinting at it and playing round it—is one of\\r\\nalmost endless accumulation of individually trivial incident, detail,\\r\\nand sometimes observation, the combined effect of which is to produce an\\r\\ninsensible but undoubting acceptance, on the reader\\'s part, of the facts\\r\\npresented to him. The process has been more than once analysed in that\\r\\ncurious and convenient miniature example of it, the \"Mrs. Veal\"\\r\\nsupercherie: but you may open the novels proper almost anywhere and\\r\\ndiscover it in full operation. Like most great processes of art, this is\\r\\nan adoption and perfecting of habits usual with the most inartistic\\r\\npeople—a turning to good account of the interminably circumstantial\\r\\nsuperfluities of the common gossip and newsmonger. Very often Defoe\\r\\nactually does not go beyond this—just as in The Shortest Way with the\\r\\nDissenters he had simply reproduced the actual thoughts and wishes of\\r\\nthose who disliked dissent. But sometimes he got the better of this\\r\\nalso, as in the elaborate building up of Robinson\\'s surroundings and not\\r\\na little in the other books. And there the effect is not only\\r\\nverisimilar but wonderful in its verisimilitude. At any rate, in him,\\r\\nand for English prose and secular fiction, we have first that mysterious\\r\\ncharm of the real that is not real—of the \"human creation\"—which\\r\\nconstitutes the appeal of the novel. In some of the books there is\\r\\nhardly any appeal of any other sort. Moll Flanders, though not unkindly,\\r\\nand \"improper\" rather from the force of circumstances than from any\\r\\nspecially vicious inclination, is certainly not a person for whom one\\r\\nhas much liking. Colonel Jack, after his youthful experiences in\\r\\npocket-picking, is rather a nonentity, something of a coward, a fellow\\r\\nof no particular wits, parts, or definite qualities of any kind. Singleton\\r\\nis a rascal who \"plays Charlemagne,\" as the French gambling term has it,\\r\\nand endows his repentance with the profits of his sin. As for Roxana there\\r\\nare few more repulsive heroines in fiction—while the Cavalier and the\\r\\nchief figure in the Voyage Round the World are simply threads on\\r\\nwhich their respective adventures are strung. Even Robinson himself enlists\\r\\nno particular sympathy except of the \"put-yourself-in-his-place\" kind. Yet\\r\\nthese sorry or negative personages, of whom, in the actual creation of God,\\r\\nwe should be content to know nothing except from paragraphs in the\\r\\nnewspaper (and generally in the police-reports thereof), content us\\r\\nperfectly well with their company through hundreds and thousands of\\r\\nsolid pages, and leave us perfectly ready to enjoy it again after\\r\\na reasonable interval.\\nThis, as has been said, is the mystery of fiction—a mystery partly set\\r\\na-working in the mediæval romance, then mostly lost, and now\\r\\nrecovered—in his own way and according to his own capacity—by Defoe.\\r\\nIt was to escape others for a little longer and then to be yet again\\r\\nrediscovered by the great quartette of the mid-eighteenth century—to\\r\\nslip in and out of hands during the later part of that century, and then\\r\\nto be all but finally established, in patterns for everlasting\\r\\npursuance, by Miss Austen and by Scott. But Defoe is really (unless we\\r\\nput Bunyan before him) the first of the magicians—not the greatest by\\r\\nany means, but great and almost alone in the peculiar talent of making\\r\\nuninteresting things interesting—not by burlesquing them or satirising\\r\\nthem; not by suffusing or inflaming them with passion; not by giving\\r\\nthem the amber of style; but by serving them \"simple of themselves\" as\\r\\nthough they actually existed.\\nThe position of Defoe in novel history is so great that there is a\\r\\ntemptation to end this chapter with him. But to do so would cause an\\r\\ninconvenience greater than any resulting advantages. For the greatest of\\r\\nDefoe\\'s contemporaries in English letters also comes into our division,\\r\\nand comes best here. One cannot conveniently rank Swift with the great\\r\\nquartette of the next chapter, because he is a novelist \"by interim\" and\\r\\nincompletely: to rank him among the minor and later novelists of the\\r\\neighteenth century would be as to the first part of the classification\\r\\nabsurd and as to the last false. And he comes, not merely in time,\\r\\npretty close to Defoe, incommensurable as is the genius of the two. It\\r\\nhas even been thought (plausibly enough, though the matter is of no\\r\\ngreat importance) that the form of Gulliver may have been to some\\r\\nextent determined by Robinson Crusoe and Defoe\\'s other novels of\\r\\ntravel. And there is a subtler reason for taking the pair together and\\r\\nboth close to Addison and Steele.\\nSwift had shown the general set towards prose fiction, and his own bent\\r\\nin the same direction, long before Defoe\\'s novel-period and as early as\\r\\nthe Tale of a Tub and the Battle of the Books (published 1704 but\\r\\ncertainly earlier in part). The easy flow of the narrative, and the\\r\\nvivid dialogue of the Spider and the Bee in the latter, rank high among\\r\\nthose premonitions of novel with which, in this place, we should be\\r\\nspecially busied. In the former Peter, Martin, and Jack want but a\\r\\nlittle more of the alchemist\\'s furnace to accomplish their projection\\r\\ninto real characters, and not merely allegorical figure-heads. But, of\\r\\ncourse, in both books, the satiric purpose dominates too much to allow\\r\\nthem to be really ranked among novels, even if they had taken the\\r\\ntrouble to clothe themselves with more of the novel-garb.\\nWith Gulliver it is different. It is a commonplace on its subject\\r\\n(but like many other commonplaces a thing ill to forget or ignore) that\\r\\nnatural and unsophisticated children always do, and that almost\\r\\nanybody who has a certain power of turning blind eyes when and where he\\r\\nchooses can, read it simply as a story of adventure and enjoy it\\r\\nhugely. It would be a most preternatural child or a most singularly\\r\\nconstituted adult who could read Utopia or Oceana, or even Cyrano\\'s\\r\\nVoyages, \"for the story\" and enjoy them hugely. This means that Swift\\r\\nhad either learnt from Defoe or—and considering those earlier\\r\\nproductions of his own much more probably—had independently developed\\r\\nthe knack of absorbing the reader—the knack of telling a story. But\\r\\nof course there is in one sense much more, and in another much less,\\r\\nthan a story in Gulliver: and the finest things in it are independent\\r\\nof story, though (and this once more comes in for our present purpose)\\r\\nthey are quite capable of adaptation to story-purposes, and have been so\\r\\nadapted ever since by the greatest masters of the art. These are strokes\\r\\nof satire, turns of phrase, little illuminations of character, and\\r\\nseasonings of description. But the great point of Gulliver is that,\\r\\nlike Defoe\\'s work, though in not quite the same way, it is\\r\\ninteresting—that it takes hold of its reader and gives him its\\r\\n\"peculiar pleasure.\" When a work of art does this, it is pretty near\\r\\nperfection.\\nThere is, however, another book of Swift\\'s which, though perhaps seldom\\r\\nmentioned or even thought of in connection with the novel, is of real\\r\\nimportance in that connection, and comes specially in with our present\\r\\nmain consideration—the way in which the several parts of the completed\\r\\nnovel were being, as it were, separately got ready and set apart for the\\r\\nuse of the accomplished novelist. This is the very curious and\\r\\nagreeable piece called Polite Conversation (1738), on which, though it\\r\\nwas not printed till late in his life and close on Pamela itself,\\r\\nthere is good reason for thinking that he had been for many years\\r\\nengaged. The importance of dialogue in the novel has been often\\r\\nmentioned and will scarcely be contested: while frequent occasion has\\r\\nbeen taken to point out that it had hitherto been very ill-achieved.\\r\\nSwift\\'s \"conversation\" though designedly underlined, as it were, to\\r\\nshow up current follies and extravagances of phrase and of fashion\\r\\ngenerally, is yet pretty certainly in the main the real average\\r\\nconversation of the society of his time, which he knew well and\\r\\nthoroughly. Further, there is a distinct, though it may be almost\\r\\nimpalpable, difference between it and the conversation of the stage,\\r\\nthough it is naturally connected therewith. Non-poetical stage dialogue\\r\\nin capable hands is either deliberate talking for display of \"wit\" like\\r\\nthat of Congreve, or is conditioned and directed by the necessities of\\r\\naction and character. Of course, novel conversation may diverge in the\\r\\nfirst direction, and cannot properly neglect the second altogether. But,\\r\\nas there is room for very much more of it, it may and should allow\\r\\nitself a considerably wider range and imitate, on proper occasions, the\\r\\ndesultory gossip and small talk of people who live on the \"boards\" of a\\r\\nroom-floor and not of a stage.\\nThis is just what Swift\\'s does, and just what there is very little of in\\r\\nDefoe; almost necessarily less in Addison and his group because of their\\r\\nessay form; and hardly anything elsewhere and earlier. Just as the\\r\\nCoverley Papers could, by one process and no difficult one, have been\\r\\nthrown into a novel; so by another, a not much more difficult and a much\\r\\nless complicated one, could the Polite Conversation be thrown into\\r\\npart of a novel—while in each case the incomplete and unintentional\\r\\ndraft itself supplies patterns for the complete work in new kind such as\\r\\nhad never been given before. Indeed the Conversation may almost be\\r\\nsaid to be part of a novel—and no small part—as it stands, and of\\r\\nsuch a novel as had never been written before.\\nBut there was something still further all but absolutely necessary to\\r\\nthe novel, though not necessary to it alone, which Defoe, Addison, and\\r\\nSwift, each in his several way, worked mightily to supply: and that was\\r\\na flexible business-like \"workaday\" prose style. Not merely so long as\\r\\nmen aimed at the eccentric and contorted styles of Euphues and the\\r\\nArcadia, but so long as the old splendid and gorgeous, but cumbrous\\r\\nand complicated pre-Restoration style lasted, romances were possible,\\r\\nbut novels were not. You might indeed pick out of Shakespeare—especially\\r\\nfrom such parts as those of Beatrice, Rosalind, and some of the fools—a\\r\\ncapital novel-style: but then you can pick almost anything out of\\r\\nShakespeare. Elsewhere the constant presence either of semi-poetic\\r\\nphraseology or of some kind of \"lingo\" was almost fatal. You want what\\r\\nSprat calls a more \"natural way of speaking\" (though not necessarily a\\r\\n\"naked\" one) for novel purposes—a certain absence of ceremony and parade\\r\\nof phrase: though the presence of slang and some other things, the rebuking\\r\\nof which was partly Swift\\'s object in the Conversation, is not\\r\\nfatal, and so he, in a manner, blessed and prescribed what he meant to ban.\\nThus, by the early years of the reign of George II., or a little later,\\r\\nwe find, on the one side, an evident, and variously though\\r\\ninarticulately proclaimed, desire for novels; on the other, the\\r\\naccumulation, in haphazard and desultory way, of almost all the methods,\\r\\nthe processes, the \"plant,\" necessary to turn novels out; but hardly\\r\\nanything except the considered work of Bunyan, Defoe, and Swift which\\r\\nreally deserves the name of novel. A similar process had been going on\\r\\nin France; and, in the different work of Le Sage and Marivaux, had\\r\\nactually produced work in the kind more advanced than anything in\\r\\nEnglish. But the tables were soon to be turned: and during the rest of\\r\\nthe century the English Novel was at last to assert itself as a\\r\\ndistinct, an increasingly popular, and a widely cultivated kind. That\\r\\nthis was due to the work of the four great novelists who fill its\\r\\ncentral third and will fill our next chapter cannot perhaps be said:\\r\\nthat their work was the first great desertion of it may be said safely.\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\nTHE FOUR WHEELS OF THE NOVEL WAIN\\nIt does not enter into the plan, because it would be entirely\\r\\ninconsistent with the scale, of the present book to give details of the\\r\\nlives of the novelists, except when they have something special to do\\r\\nwith the subject, or when (as in the case of a few minorities who happen\\r\\nto be of some importance) even well-informed readers are likely to be\\r\\nquite ignorant about them. Accounts, in all degrees of scale and\\r\\ncompetence, of the lives of Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne\\r\\nabound. It is sufficient—but in the special circumstances at this point\\r\\nperhaps necessary—here to sum the facts very briefly in so far as they\\r\\nbear on the main issue. Richardson (1689-1761), not merely the first to\\r\\nwrite, but the eldest by much more than his priority in writing, was the\\r\\nson of a Derbyshire tradesman, was educated for some time at\\r\\nCharterhouse, but apprenticed early to a printer—which trade he pursued\\r\\nwith diligence and profit for the rest of his life in London and its\\r\\nimmediate neighbourhood. After his literary success, he gathered round\\r\\nhim a circle of ladies and gentlemen interested in literature: but he\\r\\nnever had any first-hand acquaintance with general society of the\\r\\n\"gentle\" kind, much less with that of the upper classes. Fielding\\r\\n(1707-1754), on the contrary, was a member (though only as the son of a\\r\\nyounger son of a younger son) of a family of great antiquity and\\r\\ndistinction, which held an earldom in England and another in Ireland,\\r\\nand was connected as well as it was derived, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,\\r\\nfor instance, being the novelist\\'s cousin. He was educated at Eton and\\r\\nLeyden: but his branch of the family being decidedly impecunious, was\\r\\nthrown very much on his own resources. These were mainly drawn from\\r\\nliterature, first as a playwright then as a novelist, journalism and\\r\\nmiscellanies coming in. But he was called to the Bar: and though he\\r\\nprobably did not make much money there, he obtained the poorly paid and\\r\\nhard-worked but rather important position of \"Bow Street Magistrate,\"\\r\\nwhich meant that he was head, directly of the London police such as it\\r\\nwas, and indirectly of that of the whole kingdom. His temper was in some\\r\\nways as aristocratic as his birth: but though Horace Walpole\\'s accounts\\r\\nof his fancy for low company are obviously exaggerated, there is no\\r\\ndoubt that he was a good deal of what has since been called a\\r\\n\"Bohemian.\" His experience of variety in scene was much wider than\\r\\nRichardson\\'s, although after he came home from Leyden (where he went to\\r\\nstudy law) it was chiefly confined to London and the south of England\\r\\n(especially Bath, Dorsetshire, where he lived for a time, and the\\r\\nWestern Circuit), till his last voyage, in hopeless quest of health, to\\r\\nLisbon, where he died. His knowledge of literature, and even what may be\\r\\ncalled his scholarship, were considerable, and did credit to the public\\r\\nschool education of those days.\\nSmollett (1721-1771) differed from his two predecessors in being a\\r\\nScotsman: but in family was very much nearer to Fielding than to\\r\\nRichardson, being the grandson of a judge who was a Commissioner of the\\r\\nUnion, and a gentleman of birth and property—which last would, had he\\r\\nlived long enough, have come to Smollett himself. But he suffered in his\\r\\nyouth from some indistinctly known family jars, was apprenticed to a\\r\\nGlasgow surgeon, and escaping thence to London with a tragedy in his\\r\\npocket, was in undoubted difficulties till (and after) he obtained the\\r\\npost of surgeon\\'s mate on board a man-of-war, and took part in the\\r\\nCarthagena expedition. After coming home he made at least some attempts\\r\\nto practise: but was once more drawn off to literature, though\\r\\nfortunately not to tragedy. For the rest of his life he was a\\r\\nhard-worked but by no means ill-paid journalist, novelist, and\\r\\nmiscellanist, making as much as £2000 by his History of England, not\\r\\nill-written, though now never read. Like Fielding (though, unlike him,\\r\\nmore than once) he went abroad in search of health and died in the quest\\r\\nat Leghorn. Smollett was not ignorant, but he seems to have known modern\\r\\nlanguages better than ancient: though there is doubt about his direct\\r\\nshare in the translations to which he gave his name. Moreover he had\\r\\nsome though no great skill in verse.\\nLastly Sterne (1713-1768), though hardly, as it is the custom to call\\r\\nhim, \"an Irishman,\" yet vindicated the claims of the third constituent\\r\\nof the United Kingdom by being born in Ireland, from which country his\\r\\nmother came. But the Sternes were pure English, of a gentle family which\\r\\nhad migrated from East Anglia through Nottingham to Yorkshire, and was\\r\\nmuch connected with Cambridge. Thither Laurence, the novelist, after a\\r\\nvery roving childhood (his father was a soldier), and a rather irregular\\r\\neducation, duly went: and, receiving preferment in the Church from his\\r\\nYorkshire relations, lived for more than twenty years in that county\\r\\nwithout a history, till he took the literary world—hardly by storm, but\\r\\nby a sort of fantastic capful of wind—with Tristram Shandy in 1760.\\r\\nSeven or eight years of fame, some profit, not hard work (for his books\\r\\nshrink into no great solid bulk), and constant travelling, ended by a\\r\\nsudden death at his Bond Street lodgings, after a long course of\\r\\nill-health very carelessly attended to.\\nOne or two more traits are relevant. All the four were married, and\\r\\nmarried pretty early; two of them married twice. Richardson\\'s first wife\\r\\nwas, in orthodox fashion, his master\\'s daughter: of his second little is\\r\\nknown. Fielding\\'s first (he had made a vain attempt earlier to abduct an\\r\\nheiress who was a relation) was, by universal consent, the model both of\\r\\nSophia and Amelia, almost as charming as either, and as amiable; his\\r\\nsecond was her maid. Of Mrs. Smollett, who was a Miss Lascelles and a\\r\\nWest Indian heiress in a small way, we know very little—the habit of\\r\\nidentifying her with the \"Narcissa\" of Roderick Random is natural,\\r\\ninconclusive, but not ridiculous. Sterne\\'s matrimonial relations are the\\r\\nmost famous of all: and though posterity has, with its usual charity,\\r\\nconstructed a legend for the pair which is probably much worse than the\\r\\nreality, that reality is more than a little awkward. Mrs. Sterne was a\\r\\nMiss Lumley, of a good Yorkshire family, some, though small, fortune,\\r\\nand more friends who exerted themselves for her husband. By inexcusable\\r\\nlevity, ignorance, misjudgment, or heartless cupidity their daughter\\r\\nLydia published, after the death of both, letters some of which contain\\r\\ncourtship of the most lackadaisical sentimentality and others later\\r\\nexpressions (which occasionally reach the scandalous) of weariness and\\r\\ndisgust on Sterne\\'s part. Other evidence of an indisputable character\\r\\nshows that he was, at least and best, an extravagant and mawkish\\r\\nphilanderer with any girl or woman who would join in a flirtation: and\\r\\nwhile there is no evidence against Mrs. Sterne\\'s character in the\\r\\nordinary sense, and hardly any of value against her temper, she seems\\r\\n(which is perhaps not wonderful) to have latterly preferred to live\\r\\napart from her husband, and to have put him to considerable, if not\\r\\nunreasonable, expenses by her fancy for wandering about France with the\\r\\ndaughter.\\nFinally, in general character, Richardson seems to have been a\\r\\nrespectable person of rather feminine temperament and, though\\r\\ngood-natured to his friends, endowed with a feminine spitefulness.\\r\\nFielding, though by no means answering to the standard of minor and even\\r\\nmajor morals demanded\\n\\n\"by the wise ones,\\nBy the grave and the precise ones.\"\\n\\nthough reckless and disorderly in his ways and habits, appears to have\\r\\nbeen in the main a thorough gentleman, faithful to truth and honour,\\r\\nfearless, compassionate, intolerant of meanness and brutality and of\\r\\ntreachery most of all—a man of many faults perhaps, but of no really\\r\\nbad or disgusting ones. Concerning Smollett\\'s personality we know least\\r\\nof all the four. It was certainly disfigured by an almost savage\\r\\npugnacity of temper; by a strange indifference to what ought to be at\\r\\nthe lowest the conduct of a gentleman, and by a most repulsive\\r\\ninclination—perhaps natural, but developed by training—to the merely\\r\\nfoul and nasty. But he seems to have been brave, charitable though not\\r\\nin the most gracious way, honest, and on the whole a much better fellow\\r\\nthan he might generally seem. Sterne is the most difficult of the four\\r\\nto characterise fairly, because of the unlucky revelations to which we\\r\\npossess no parallel in the case of the other three, and which, if we had\\r\\nthem, might probably alter our estimates of a good many now well reputed\\r\\npeople. It is perhaps enough to say that his letters contain many good\\r\\ntraits as well as some bad ones; that his unlucky portrait, with its\\r\\ncombination of leer and sneer, is probably responsible for much; and\\r\\nthat the parts which, as we shall see further, he chose to play, of\\r\\nextravagant humorist and extravagant sentimentalist, not only almost\\r\\nnecessitate attitudes which may easily become offensive in the playing,\\r\\nbut are very likely, in practice, to communicate something apparently\\r\\nnot natural and unattractive to the player.\\nBut enough of the workers, though not too much in the case of such\\r\\nremarkable contemporary exponents of a new kind of Human Comedy: let us\\r\\ngo to the work.\\nIn the long \"History of the Unexpected,\" thick-strewn as it is with\\r\\ncuriosities, there are few things odder than the appearance and the\\r\\nsequels of Pamela: or Virtue Rewarded, which, in circumstances to be\\r\\nnoted presently, is said to have been begun on November 12, 1739, was\\r\\nfinished (as far as the first part goes) exactly two months later, and\\r\\n(there being, in the case of the author\\'s business, no obstacle of the\\r\\nkind that has frequently beset the appearance of greater works) was\\r\\npublished later in the year 1740. That author was over fifty years old:\\r\\nthough he had had much to do with ushering literature into the world, he\\r\\nhad never attempted to produce it; he belonged to a class which was apt\\r\\nto regard belles lettres with profound suspicion; and his experiences,\\r\\nboth in literature itself and in life, had been necessarily of the most\\r\\nlimited kind. But there were certain counterbalancing facts to be taken\\r\\ninto consideration which, though they can hardly be said to be causes\\r\\nof the marvel—the cause was the Hour, which hit, as it listed, on the\\r\\nMan—were a little more than accidental occasions of it. Richardson, as\\r\\nwe see from his work, must have been a rather careful student of such\\r\\nnovels as there were. The name of his first heroine, with the\\r\\nessentially English throwing back of the accent added, is the same as\\r\\nthat of one of Sidney\\'s heroines in the Arcadia, which had been not\\r\\nlong before modernised for eighteenth-century reading by a certain Mrs.\\r\\nStanley. The not very usual form \"Laurana,\" which is the name of a\\r\\ncharacter in his latest novel, is that of the heroine of Parismus.\\r\\nFurther, he had had curious early experiences (which we know from his\\r\\nown meticulous revelations) of writing love-letters, when he was a mere\\r\\nboy, for girl-friends of his to adapt in writing to their lovers. \"His\\r\\neye,\" he says, \"had been always on the ladies,\" though no doubt always\\r\\nalso in the most honourable way. And, quite recently, the\\r\\ncrystallisation had been precipitated by a commission from two of his\\r\\nbookseller (i.e. publisher) patrons—the founder of the House of\\r\\nRivington and the unlucky Osborne who was knocked down by Johnson and\\r\\npicked up (not quite as one would wish to be) by Pope. They asked him to\\r\\nprepare a series of \"Familiar Letters on the useful concerns of common\\r\\nlife.\" Five-and-twenty years before, he had heard in outline something\\r\\nlike the story of Pamela. In shaping this into letters he thought it\\r\\nmight be a \"new species of writing that might possibly turn young people\\r\\ninto a course of reading different from the pomp and parade of\\r\\nromance-writing, and dismissing the improbable and marvellous with which\\r\\nnovels generally abound, might tend to promote the cause of religion and\\r\\nvirtue.\" His wife and \"a young lady living with them,\" to whom he had\\r\\nread some of it, used to come into his little closet every night with,\\r\\n\"Have you any more of Pamela, Mr. R.?\" Two other female friends joined\\r\\nin the interest and eulogy. He finished it (that is, the first two\\r\\nvolumes which contain the whole of the original idea) and published it,\\r\\nthough at first with the business-like precaution of appearing to \"edit\"\\r\\nonly, and the more business-like liberty of liberal praise of what he\\r\\nedited. It became at once popular: and received the often repeated, but\\r\\nto the author very annoying, compliment of piratical continuation. So he\\r\\nset to work and continued it himself: as usually (though by no means\\r\\ninvariably) with rather diminished success. On such points as the\\r\\nsuggestion that he may have owed a debt to Marivaux (in Marianne) and\\r\\nothers, little need be said here. I have never had much doubt myself\\r\\nthat the indebtedness existed: though it would be rash, and is\\r\\nunnecessary, to attempt to determine to what extent and in what\\r\\nparticular form.\\nIt is by no means so difficult as it may at first sight appear to put\\r\\noneself very much in the situation of a contemporary reader of Pamela,\\r\\neven if one has read it three or four times, provided that a fairly long\\r\\nperiod has elapsed since the last reading, and that the novels of the\\r\\npreceding age are fairly—and freshly—familiar. The thing has been in\\r\\nfact done—with unexpected but not in the least deliberate or suspicious\\r\\nsuccess—by the present writer, who has read the book after an interval\\r\\nof some fifteen years and just after reading (in some cases again, in\\r\\nsome for the first time) most of the works noticed in the preceding\\r\\nchapter. The difference of \"the new species of writing\" (one is reminded\\r\\nof the description of Spenser as \"the new poet\") is almost startling:\\r\\nand of a kind which Richardson pretty certainly did not fully apprehend\\r\\nwhen he used the phrase. In order to appreciate it, one must not only\\r\\nleave out the two last volumes (which, as has been said, the first\\r\\nreaders had not before them at all, and had better never have had) but\\r\\nalso the second, or great part of it, which they would only have reached\\r\\nafter they had been half whetted, half satiated, and wholly bribed, by\\r\\nthe first. The defects of this later part and indeed of the first itself\\r\\nwill be duly noticed presently. Let it be to us, for the moment, the\\r\\nstory of Pamela up to and including \"Mr. B.\\'s\" repentance and amendment\\r\\nof mind: and the \"difference\" of this story, which fills some hundred\\r\\nand twenty or thirty closely printed, double columned, royal octavo\\r\\npages in the \"Ballantyne Novels,\" is (despite the awkwardness of such a\\r\\nform for the enjoyment of a novel) almost astounding.\\nTo begin with, the novel-attractions are presented with a completeness\\r\\nwhich, as has been pointed out in the last chapter, is almost entirely\\r\\nlacking before. There is, of course, not very much plot, in the martinet\\r\\nsense of that word: there never was in Richardson, despite his immense\\r\\napparatus and elaboration. The story is not knotted and unknotted; the\\r\\nwheel does not come full circle on itself; it merely runs along\\r\\npleasantly till it is time for it to stop, and it stops rather abruptly.\\r\\nThe siege of Pamela\\'s virtue ends merely because the besieger is tired\\r\\nof assaults which fail, and of offering dishonourable terms of\\r\\ncapitulation which are rejected: because he prefers peace and alliance.\\r\\nBut such as it is, it is told with a spirit which must have been\\r\\nsurprising enough to its readers, and which makes it, I confess, seem to\\r\\nme now much the best story in Richardson. The various alarums and\\r\\nexcursions of the siege itself go off smartly and briskly: there may be\\r\\nmore sequence than connection—there is some connection, as in the\\r\\ncase of that most unlucky and ill-treated person the Rev. Mr.\\r\\nWilliams—but the sequence is rapid and unbroken, and the constituents\\r\\nof it as it were jostle each other—not in any unfavourable sense, but\\r\\nin a sort of rapid dance, \"cross hands and down the middle,\" which is\\r\\ninspiriting and contagious. He lost this faculty later: or rather he\\r\\nallowed it to be diluted and slackened into the interminable episodes of\\r\\nthe not dissimilar though worse-starred plot against Clarissa, and the\\r\\nmassacrant trivialities of the Italian part of Grandison. But he had\\r\\nit here: and it is not a fair argument to say (as even in these days I\\r\\nhave known it said) that Pamela\\'s honour is a commodity of too little\\r\\nimportance to justify such a pother about it.\\nThis may bring us to the characters. They also are not of the absolutely\\r\\nfirst class—excepting, as to be discussed later, the great attempt of\\r\\nLovelace, Richardson\\'s never are. But they are an immense advance on the\\r\\npersonages that did duty as persons in preceding novels, even in Defoe.\\r\\n\"Mr. B.\" himself is indeed not very capital. One does not quite see why\\r\\na man who went on as long as he did and used the means which he\\r\\npermitted himself to use, did not go on longer or use them more\\r\\nthoroughly. But Richardson has at least vindicated his much-praised\\r\\n\"knowledge of the human heart\" by recognising two truths: first, that\\r\\nthere are many natures (perhaps most) who are constantly tempted to\\r\\n\"over-bid\"—to give more and more for something that they want and\\r\\ncannot get; and, secondly, that there are others (again, perhaps, the\\r\\nmajority, if not always the same individuals) who, when they are\\r\\nperemptorily told not to do a thing, at once determine to do it. It\\r\\nwas to Lady Davers mainly that Pamela owed her escape from the fate of\\r\\nClarissa, though she would hardly have taken, or had the chance of\\r\\ntaking, that fate in the same way. As for the minor characters, at least\\r\\nthe lower examples are more than sufficient: and Mrs. Jewkes wants very\\r\\nlittle of being a masterpiece. But of course Pamela herself is the\\r\\ncynosure, such as there is. She has had rather hard measure with critics\\r\\nfor the last century and a little more. The questions to ask now are,\\r\\n\"Is she a probable human being?\" and then, \"Where are we to find a\\r\\nprobable human being, worked out to the same degree, before?\" I say\\r\\nunhesitatingly that the answer to the first is \"Yes,\" and the answer to\\r\\nthe second \"Nowhere.\" The last triumph of originality and individuality\\r\\nshe does not indeed reach. Richardson had, even more than other men of\\r\\nhis century in England, a strong Gallic touch: and he always tends to\\r\\nthe type rather than the individual. Beatrix Esmond is a coquette of the\\r\\nhighest—almost of the heroic-poetic—class, but she is first of all\\r\\nBeatrix Esmond. Blanche Amory is a middle-class minx, hardly heroic at\\r\\nall, but she is first of all Blanche Amory. Becky Sharp is an\\r\\nadventuress who would go pretty close to, and perhaps not stop at,\\r\\npositive crime, but she is first of all Becky Sharp. Pamela Andrews is\\r\\nnot first of all—perhaps she is hardly at all—Pamela Andrews. There\\r\\nmight be fifty or five hundred Pamelas, while there could be only one of\\r\\neach of the others. She is the pretty, good-natured, well-principled,\\r\\nand rather well-educated menial, whose prudence comes to the aid of her\\r\\nprinciples, whose pride does not interfere with either, and who has a\\r\\ncertain—it is hardly unfair to call it—slyness which is of the sex\\r\\nrather than of the individual. But, as such, she is quite admirably\\r\\nworked out—a heroine of Racine in more detail and different\\r\\ncircumstances, a triumph of art, and at the same time with so much\\r\\nnature that it is impossible to dismiss her as merely artificial. The\\r\\nnearest thing to her in English prose fiction before (Marianne, of\\r\\ncourse, is closer in French) is Moll Flanders: and good as Moll is, she\\r\\nis flat and lifeless in comparison with Pamela. You may call \"my\\r\\nmaster\\'s\" mistress (actually in the honourable sense, but never in the\\r\\ndishonourable) again a minx, though a better minx than Blanche, if you\\r\\nlike. But there is no animal more alive than a minx: and you will\\r\\ncertainly not find a specimen of the species in any English novel\\r\\nbefore.\\nAs for description and dialogue, there is not very much of the former\\r\\nin Pamela, though it might not be unfair to include under the head\\r\\nthose details, after the manner of Defoe (such as Pamela\\'s list of\\r\\npurchases when she thinks she is going home), which supply their own\\r\\nmeasure of verisimilitude to the story. But there are some things of the\\r\\nkind which Defoe never would have thought of—such as the touches of\\r\\nthe \"tufts of grass\" and the \"pretty sort of wildflower that grows\\r\\nyonder near the elm, the fifth from us on the left,\" which occur in the\\r\\ngipsy scene. The dialogue plays a much more important part: and may be\\r\\nbrought into parallel with that in the Polite Conversation, referred\\r\\nto above and published just before Pamela. It is \"reported\" of course,\\r\\ninstead of being directly delivered, in accordance with the\\r\\nletter-scheme of which more presently, but that makes very little\\r\\ndifference; to the first readers it probably made no difference at all.\\r\\nHere again that process of \"vivification,\" which has been so often dwelt\\r\\non, makes an astonishing progress—the blood and colour of the novel,\\r\\nwhich distinguish it from the more statuesque narrative, are supplied,\\r\\nif indirectly yet sufficiently and, in comparison with previous\\r\\nexamples, amply. Here you get, almost or quite for the first time in the\\r\\nEnglish novel, those spurts and sparks of animation which only the\\r\\nliving voice can supply. Richardson is a humorist but indirectly; yet\\r\\nonly the greatest humorists have strokes much better than that admirable\\r\\ntouch in which, when the \"reconciliations and forgivenesses of injuries\"\\r\\nare being arranged, and Mr. B. (quite in the manner of the time)\\r\\nsuggests marrying Mrs. Jewkes to the treacherous footman John and giving\\r\\nthem an inn to keep—Pamela, the mild and semi-angelic but exceedingly\\r\\nfeminine Pamela, timidly inquires whether, \"This would not look like\\r\\nvery heavy punishment to poor John?\" She forgives Mrs. Jewkes of course,\\r\\nbut only \"as a Christian\"—as a greater than Richardson put it\\r\\nafterwards and commented on it in the mouth of a personage whom\\r\\nRichardson could never have drawn, though Fielding most certainly could.\\nThe original admirers of Pamela, then, were certainly justified: and\\r\\neven the rather fatuous eulogies which the author prefixed to it from\\r\\nhis own and (let us hope) other pens (and which probably provoked\\r\\nFielding himself more than even the substance of the piece) could be\\r\\ntransposed into a reasonable key. But we ought nowadays to consider this\\r\\nfirst complete English novel from a rather higher point of view, and ask\\r\\nourselves, not merely what its comparative merits were in regard to its\\r\\npredecessors, and as presented to its first readers, but what its\\r\\npositive character is and what, as far as it goes, are the positive\\r\\nmerits or defects which it shows in its author.\\nThe first thing to strike one in this connection is, almost of course,\\r\\nthe letter-form. More agreement has been reached about this, perhaps,\\r\\nthan about some other points in the inquiry. The initial difficulty of\\r\\nfiction which does not borrow the glamour of verse or of the stage is\\r\\nthe question, \"What does all this mean?\" \"What is the authority?\" \"How\\r\\ndoes the author know it all?\" And a hundred critics have pointed out\\r\\nthat there are practically only three ways of meeting this. The boldest\\r\\nand the best by far is to follow the poet and the dramatist themselves;\\r\\nto treat it like one of the magic lions of romance, ignore it, and pass\\r\\non, secure of safety, to tell your story \"from the blue,\" as if it were\\r\\nan actual history or revelation, or something passing before the eyes of\\r\\nthe reader. But at that time few novelists had the courage to do this,\\r\\ndaunted as they were by the absence of the sword and shield of verse,\\r\\nof the vantage-room of the stage. Then there is the alternative of\\r\\nrecounting it by the mouth of one of the actors in, or spectators of,\\r\\nthe events—a plan obvious, early, presenting some advantages, still\\r\\nvery commonly followed, but always full of little traps and pits of\\r\\nimprobability, and peculiarly trying in respect to the character (if he\\r\\nis made to have any) of the narrator himself. Thirdly, there is the\\r\\nagain easy resource of the \"document\" in its various forms. Of these,\\r\\nletters and diaries possess some prerogative advantages; and were likely\\r\\nto suggest themselves very particularly at this time when the actual\\r\\nletter and diary (long rather strangely rare in English) had for some\\r\\ngenerations appeared, and were beginning to be common. In the first\\r\\nplace the information thus obtained looks natural and plausible: and\\r\\nthere is a subsidiary advantage—on which Richardson does not draw very\\r\\nmuch in Pamela, but which he employs to the full later—that by\\r\\nvarying your correspondents you can get different views of the same\\r\\nevent, and first-hand manifestations of extremely different characters.\\nIts disadvantages, on the other hand, are equally obvious: but there are\\r\\ntwo or three of them of especial importance. In the first place, it is\\r\\nessentially an artificial rather than an artful plan—its want of\\r\\nverisimilitude, as soon as you begin to think of it, is as great as that\\r\\nof either of the others if not greater. In the second, without immense\\r\\npains, it must be \"gappy and scrappy,\" while the more these pains are\\r\\ntaken the more artificial it will become. In the third, the book is\\r\\nextremely likely, in the taking of these pains and even without them, to\\r\\nbecome intolerably lengthy and verbose. In the first part at least of\\r\\nthe first part of Pamela, Richardson avoided these dangers fairly if\\r\\nnot fully; in the second part he succumbed to them; in his two later\\r\\nnovels, though more elaborate and important plots to some extent bore up\\r\\nthe expansion, he succumbed to them almost more. Pains have been taken\\r\\nabove to show how the first readers of Pamela might rejoice in it,\\r\\nbecause of its contrast with the character of the seventeenth-century\\r\\nnovel which was most read—the Scudéry or \"heroic\" romance. It is not, I\\r\\nthink, too severe to say that nothing but the parallel with that\\r\\nromance, and the tolerance induced by familiarity with it, could make\\r\\nany one put up with the second part of Pamela itself, or with the\\r\\ninhumanly prolonged divagation of Clarissa and Grandison. Nor, as\\r\\nhas been hinted, is the solace of the letters—in the opportunity of\\r\\nsetting forth different tempers and styles—here much taken.\\nThere is no doubt that one main attraction of this letter-plan (whether\\r\\nconsciously experienced or not does not matter) was its ready adaptation\\r\\nto Richardson\\'s own special and peculiar gift of minute analysis of\\r\\nmood, temper, and motive. The diary avowedly, and the letter in reality,\\r\\neven though it may be addressed to somebody else, is a continuous\\r\\nsoliloquy: and the novelist can use it with a frequency and to a length\\r\\nwhich would be intolerable and impossible on the stage. Now soliloquy is\\r\\nthe great engine for self—revelation and analysis. It is of course to a\\r\\ngreat extent in consequence of this analysis that Richardson owes his\\r\\npride of place in the general judgment. It is quite possible to lay too\\r\\nmuch stress on it, as distinguishing the novel from the romance: and the\\r\\npresent writer is of opinion that too much stress has actually been\\r\\nlaid. The real difference between romance per se and novel per se\\r\\n(so far as they are capable of distinct existence) is that the romance\\r\\ndepends more on incident and the novel more on character. Now this\\r\\nminute analysis and exhibition, though it is one way of drawing or\\r\\nconstructing character, is not the only, nor even a necessary, one. It\\r\\ncan be done without: but it has impressed the vulgar, and even some who\\r\\nare not the vulgar, from Dr. Johnson to persons whom it is unnecessary\\r\\nto mention. They cannot believe that there is \"no deception\"—that the\\r\\ntime is correctly told—unless the works of the watch are bared to them:\\r\\nand this Richardson most undoubtedly does. Even in his \\'prentice work,\\r\\nevery flutter of Pamela\\'s little heart is registered, and registered\\r\\nprobably enough: nor could the registry have been effected, perhaps, in\\r\\nany other way that should be in the least probable so well as by the\\r\\nletter and journal method. Of course this analysis was not quite new; it\\r\\nhad existed in a sort of way in the heroic novel: and it had been\\r\\neminently present in the famous Princesse de Clèves of Madame de la\\r\\nFayette as well as in her French successors. But these stories had\\r\\ngenerally been as short as the heroics had been long: and no one had\\r\\nrisen (or descended) to anything like the minuteness and fullness of\\r\\nRichardson. As was before pointed out in regard to the letter-system\\r\\ngenerally, this method of treatment is exposed to special dangers,\\r\\nparticularly those of verbosity and \"overdoing\"—not to mention the\\r\\ngreater one of missing the mark. Richardson can hardly be charged with\\r\\nerror, though he may be with excess, in regard to Pamela herself in the\\r\\nearlier part of the book—perhaps even not in regard to Mr. B.\\'s\\r\\nintricacies of courtship, matrimonial compliment, and arbitrary temper\\r\\nlater. But he certainly succumbs to them in the long and monstrous scene\\r\\nin which Lady Davers bullies, storms at, and positively assaults her\\r\\nunfortunate sister-in-law before she is forced to allow that she is\\r\\nher sister-in-law. Part of course of his error here comes from the\\r\\nmistake with which Lady Mary afterwards most justly reproached\\r\\nhim—that he talked about fine ladies and gentlemen without knowing\\r\\nanything about them. It was quite natural for Lady Davers to be\\r\\ndisgusted, to be incredulous, to be tyrannical, to be in a certain sense\\r\\nviolent. But it is improbable that she would in any case have spoken and\\r\\nbehaved like a drunken fishfag quarrelling with another in the street:\\r\\nand the extreme prolongation of the scene brings its impropriety more\\r\\nforcibly into view. Here, as elsewhere (a point of great importance to\\r\\nwhich I may invite attention), Richardson follows out, with\\r\\nextraordinary minuteness and confidence, a wrong course: and his very\\r\\nexpertness in the process betrays him and brings him to grief. If he had\\r\\nrun the false scent for a few yards only it would not matter: in a chase\\r\\nprolonged to something like \"Hartleap Well\" extension there is less\\r\\nexcuse for his not finding it out. Nevertheless it would of course be\\r\\nabsurd not to rank this \"knowledge of the human heart\" among the claims\\r\\nwhich not only gave him but have kept his reputation. I do not know that\\r\\nhe shows it much less in the later part of the first two volumes\\r\\n(Pamela\\'s recurrent tortures of jealous curiosity about Sally Godfrey\\r\\nare admirable) or even in the dreary sequel. But analysis for analysis\\'\\r\\nsake can have few real, though it may have some pretended, devotees.\\nThe foregoing remarks have been designed, less as a criticism of\\r\\nPamela (which would be unnecessary here), or even of Richardson (which\\r\\nwould be more in place, but shall be given in brief presently), than as\\r\\nan account and justification of the book\\'s position in the real subject\\r\\nof this volume—the History of the English Novel. And this account will\\r\\ndispense us from dealing, at corresponding length, with the individually\\r\\nmore important but historically subordinate books which followed. Of\\r\\nthese Clarissa, as few people can be ignorant, is a sort of enlarged,\\r\\ndiversified, and transposed Pamela, in which the attempts of a\\r\\nlibertine of more resolution and higher gifts than Mr. B. upon a young\\r\\nlady of much more than proportionately higher station and qualities than\\r\\nPamela\\'s, are—as such success goes—successful at last: but only to\\r\\nresult in the death of the victim and the punishment of the criminal.\\r\\nThe book is far longer than even the extended Pamela; has a much wider\\r\\nrange; admits of episodes and minor plots, and is altogether much more\\r\\nambitious; but still—though the part of the seducer Lovelace is much\\r\\nmore important than that of Mr. B.—it is chiefly occupied with the\\r\\nheroine. In Sir Charles Grandison, on the contrary, though no less\\r\\nthan three heroines exist after a fashion and are carefully treated, the\\r\\nauthor\\'s principal object is to depict—in direct contrast to Mr. B. and\\r\\nLovelace—a \"Good Man\"—the actual first title of the book, which he\\r\\nwisely altered. This faultless and insufferable monster is frantically\\r\\nbeloved by, and hesitates long between, two beauties, the Italian\\r\\nClementina della Porretta and the English Harriet Byron. The latter of\\r\\nthese carries him off (rather because of religious difficulties than of\\r\\nany great predilection on his own part) and the piece ends with a\\r\\nrepetition, extension, and intensification of the bounties showered upon\\r\\nPamela by her husband, and her almost abject gratitude for them. Only of\\r\\ncourse \"the good man\" could never be guilty of Mr. B.\\'s meditated\\r\\nrelapse from the path of rectitude, nor (one may perhaps add) does Miss\\r\\nByron seem to possess the insinuating astuteness by which Pamela once\\r\\nmore\\n\\n\"Reconciles the new perverted man,\"\\n\\nto adapt the last line of A Lover\\'s Complaint to the situation.\\nGrandison, like Clarissa, has a much wider range of personage and\\r\\nincident than Pamela, and is again double the length of it. No\\r\\ndetailed criticism of these enormous books (both of which are conducted\\r\\nin the letter-form, though, in the latter case especially, with long\\r\\nretrospects and narratives which rather strain the style) is possible\\r\\nhere. But a few remarks on the characters of Lovelace and Clarissa,\\r\\nwhich have usually been regarded as Richardson\\'s greatest triumphs, may\\r\\nfitly precede some on his whole character as a novelist.\\nAdmiration and sympathy, tempered with a few reserves, have been the\\r\\ngeneral notes of comment on Clarissa: and—as she goes through the long\\r\\nmartyrdom of persecution by her family for not marrying the man she does\\r\\nnot love; of worse persecution from the man whom she does love, but who\\r\\nwill not marry her, at least until he has conquered her virtue; and of\\r\\nperhaps worst when she feels it her duty to resist his repentant and (as\\r\\nsuch things go) honourable proffers after he has treacherously deprived\\r\\nher of technical honour—compassion at least is impossible to refuse.\\r\\nBut \"compassion,\" though it literally translates \"sympathy\" from Greek\\r\\ninto Latin, is not its synonym in English. It is a disagreeable thing to\\r\\nhave to say: but Clarissa\\'s purity strikes one as having at once too\\r\\nmuch questionable prudery in it and too little honest prudence: while\\r\\nher later resolution has as much false pride as real principle. Even\\r\\nsome of her admirers admit a want of straightforwardness in her; she has\\r\\nno passion, which rather derogates from the merit of her conduct in any\\r\\ncase; and though she is abominably ill-treated by almost everybody,\\r\\none\\'s pity for her never comes very near to love.\\nTowards Lovelace, on the other hand, the orthodox attitude, with even\\r\\ngreater uniformity, has been shocked, or sometimes even unshocked,\\r\\nadmiration. Hazlitt went into frequently quoted raptures over the\\r\\n\"regality\" of his character: and though to approve of him as a man would\\r\\nonly be the pretence of a cheap paradoxer, general opinion seems to have\\r\\ngone various lengths in the same direction. There have, however, been a\\r\\nfew dissenters: and I venture to join myself to them in the very\\r\\ndissidence of their dissent. Lovelace, it is true, is a most\\r\\nastonishingly \"succeeded\" blend of a snob\\'s fine gentleman and of the\\r\\nfine gentleman of a silly and rather unhealthy-minded schoolgirl. He\\r\\nis—it is difficult to resist the temptation of dropping and inserting\\r\\nthe h\\'s—handsome, haughty, arbitrary, as well as rich, generous after a\\r\\nfashion, well descended, well dressed, well mannered—except when he is\\r\\ninsolent. He is also—which certainly stands to his credit in the bank\\r\\nwhich is not that of the snob or the schoolgirl—no fool in a general\\r\\nway. But he is not in the least a gentleman except in externals: and\\r\\nthere is nothing really \"great\" about him at all. Even his scoundrelism\\r\\nis mostly, if not wholly, pose—which abominable thing indeed\\r\\ndistinguishes him throughout, in every speech and every act, from the\\r\\ntime when he sighs as he kisses Miss Arabella Harlowe\\'s hand to the time\\r\\nwhen he says, \"Let this expiate!\" as that hallowed sword of Colonel\\r\\nMorden\\'s passes through his rotten heart. Now if Richardson had meant\\r\\nthis, it might be granted at once that Lovelace is one of the greatest\\r\\ncharacters of fiction: and I do not deny that taken as this, meant or\\r\\nnot meant, he is great. But Richardson obviously did not mean it; and\\r\\nHazlitt did not mean it; and none of the admirers mean it. They all\\r\\nthought and think that Lovelace is something like what Milton\\'s Satan\\r\\nwas, and what my Lord Byron would have liked to be. This is very unfair\\r\\nto the Prince of Darkness: and it is even not quite just to \"the noble\\r\\npoet.\"\\nAt the same time, the acute reader will have noticed, the acknowledgment\\r\\nthat the fact that Richardson—even not knowing it and intending to do\\r\\nsomething else—did hit off perfectly and consummately the ideal of such\\r\\na \"prevailing party\" (to quote Lord Foppington) as snobs and\\r\\nschoolgirls, is a serious and splendid tribute to his merits: as is also\\r\\nthe fact that his two chief characters are characters still interesting\\r\\nand worth arguing about. Those merits, indeed, are absolutely\\r\\nincontestable. His immediate and immense popularity, abroad as well as\\r\\nat home, would not necessarily prove much, though it must not be\\r\\nneglected, and historically, at least, is of the first importance. But\\r\\nhe does not need it.\\nFor, as should have been sufficiently shown, he did very great\\r\\nthings—first by gathering up the scattered means and methods which had\\r\\nbeen half ignorantly hit on by others, and co-ordinating them into the\\r\\nproduction of the finished and complete novel; secondly (though less) by\\r\\nthat infusion of elaborate \"minor psychology\" as it may be called, which\\r\\nis his great characteristic; and, thirdly, by means of it and of other\\r\\nthings, in raising the pitch of interest in his readers to an infinitely\\r\\nhigher degree than had ever been known before. The dithyrambs of Diderot\\r\\nare, though not ridiculously, amusingly excessive: but they are only an\\r\\nexaggeration of the truth. On the comic side he was weak: and he made a\\r\\nmost unfortunate mistake by throwing this part of the business on young\\r\\nladies of position and (as he thought) of charm—Miss Darnford, Miss\\r\\nHowe, Charlotte Grandison—who are by no means particularly comic and\\r\\nwho are sometimes very particularly vulgar. But of tragedy positive, in\\r\\nthe bourgeois kind, he had no small command, and in the middle\\r\\nbusiness—in affairs neither definitely comic nor definitely tragic—he\\r\\nwas wonderfully prolific and facile. His immense and heart-breaking\\r\\nlengthiness is not mere verbosity: it comes partly from the artist\\'s\\r\\nnatural delight in a true and newly found method, partly from a still\\r\\nmore respectably artistic desire not to do the work negligently. As for\\r\\nthe unhealthiness of atmosphere which has been generally and not\\r\\nunjustly charged upon him, it is, in part, no doubt the result of\\r\\nimperfect temperament and breeding: but it is also as closely connected\\r\\nwith his very method as are the merits thereof. You cannot \"consider so\\r\\ncuriously\" without considering too curiously. The drawbacks of his work\\r\\nare obvious, and they were likely to be, and were, exaggerated. But they\\r\\nmight be avoided and the merits kept: nor is it too much to say that the\\r\\ntriumphs of the English novel in the last century have been not a little\\r\\ndue to the avoidance of the one and the keeping of the other.\\nIt would be, in the circumstances, peculiarly uncivil and disobliging\\r\\nto lay very much stress on the fact that, after all, the greatest\\r\\nof Richardson\\'s works is his successor, caricaturist, and\\r\\nsuperior—Fielding. When the memoirs of Miss Pamela Andrews appeared,\\r\\nthe future biographer of her doubly supposititious brother was a not\\r\\nvery young man of thirty-three, who had written a good many not very\\r\\ngood plays, had contributed to periodicals, and had done a little work\\r\\nat the Bar, besides living, at least till his marriage and it may be\\r\\nfeared later, an exceedingly \"rackety\" life. It is not improbable,\\r\\nthough it is not certain, that he had already turned his attention to\\r\\nprose fiction of a kind. For, though the Miscellanies which followed\\r\\nJoseph Andrews were three years later than Pamela in appearance,\\r\\nthe Journey from this World to the Next which they contain has the\\r\\nimmaturity of earliness; and we can hardly conceive it as written after\\r\\nthe adventures and character of Mr. Abraham Adams. It is unequal, rather\\r\\ntedious in parts, and in conception merely a pastiche of Lucian and\\r\\nFontenelle: but it contains some remarkable things in the way of shrewd\\r\\nsatirical observation of human nature. And the very fact that it is a\\r\\nfollowing of something else is interesting, in connection with the\\r\\ninfinitely more important work that preceded it in publication, The\\r\\nAdventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams (1742).\\nNobody has ever had much difficulty in accounting for the way in which\\r\\nFielding availed himself of the appearance and popularity of Pamela.\\r\\nAnd though Richardson would have been superhuman instead of very human\\r\\nindeed (with an ordinary British middle-class humanity, and an\\r\\nextraordinary vein of genius) if he had done otherwise, few have joined\\r\\nhim in thinking Joseph a \"lewd and ungenerous engraftment.\" We have\\r\\nnot ourselves been very severe on the faults of Pamela, the reason of\\r\\nlenity being, among other things, that it in a manner produced Fielding,\\r\\nand all the fair herd of his successors down to the present day. But\\r\\nthose faults are glaring: and they were of a kind specially likely to\\r\\nattract the notice and the censure of a genial, wholesome, and, above\\r\\nall, masculine taste and intellect like Fielding\\'s. Even at that time,\\r\\nlibertine as it was in some ways, and sentimental as it was in others,\\r\\npeople had not failed to notice that Pamela\\'s virtue is not quite what\\r\\nwas then called \"neat\" wine—the pure and unadulterated juice of the\\r\\ngrape. The longueurs and the fiddle-faddle, the shameless and fulsome\\r\\npreface-advertisements and the rest lay open enough to censure. So\\r\\nFielding saw the handles, and gripped them at once by starting a male\\r\\nPamela—a situation not only offering \"most excellent differences,\" but\\r\\nin itself possessing, to graceless humanity at all times it may be\\r\\nfeared, and at that time perhaps specially, something essentially\\r\\nludicrous in minor points. At first he kept the parody very close:\\r\\nthough the necessary transposition of the parts afforded opportunity\\r\\n(amply taken) for display of character and knowledge of nature superior\\r\\nto Richardson\\'s own. Later the general opinion is that he, especially\\r\\ninspirited by his trouvaille of Adams, almost forgot the parody, and\\r\\nonly furbished up the Pamela-connection at the end to make a formal\\r\\ncorrespondence with the beginning, and to get a convenient and\\r\\nconventional \"curtain.\" I am not so sure of this. Even Adams is to a\\r\\ncertain extent suggested by Williams, though they turn out such very\\r\\ndifferent persons. Mrs. Slipslop, a character, as Gray saw, not so very\\r\\nfar inferior to Adams, is not only a parallel to Mrs. Jewkes, but also,\\r\\nand much more, a contrast to the respectable Mrs. Jervis and Mrs.\\r\\nWarden. All sorts of fantastic and not-fantastic doublets may be traced\\r\\nthroughout: and I am not certain that Parson Trulliber\\'s majestic\\r\\ndoctrine that no man, even in his own house, shall drink when he \"caaled\\r\\nvurst\" is not a demoniacally ingenious travesty of Pamela\\'s\\r\\ncharacteristic casuistry, when she says that she will do anything to\\r\\npropitiate Lady Davers, but she will not \"fill wine\" to her in her own\\r\\nhusband\\'s house.\\nBut this matters little: and we have no room for it. Suffice it as\\r\\nagreed and out of controversy that Joseph Andrews started as a parody\\r\\nof Pamela and that, whether in addition or in substitution, it turned\\r\\nto something very different. It is not quite so uncontroversial, but\\r\\nwill be asserted here as capable of all but demonstration, that the\\r\\n\"something different\" is also something much greater. There is still not\\r\\nvery much plot—the parody did not necessitate and indeed rather\\r\\ndiscouraged that, and what there is is arrived at chiefly by the old and\\r\\nseldom very satisfactory system of anagnorisis—the long-lost-child\\r\\nbusiness. But, under the three other heads, Joseph distances his sister\\r\\nhopelessly and can afford her much more than weight for sex. It has been\\r\\nsaid that there are doubtfully in Richardson anywhere, and certainly not\\r\\nin Pamela, those startling creations of personality which are almost\\r\\nmore real to us than the persons we know in the flesh. It is not that\\r\\nPamela and her meyney are unreal; for they are not: but that they are\\r\\nnot personal. The Reverend Abraham Adams is a good deal more real than\\r\\nhalf the parsons who preached last Sunday, and a good deal more\\r\\npersonal: and the quality is not confined to him, though he has most of\\r\\nit. So, too, with the description. The time was not yet for any minute\\r\\nor elaborate picture-setting. But here again also that extra dose of\\r\\nlife and action—almost of bustle—which Fielding knows how to instil is\\r\\npresent. In Pamela the settings are frequent, but they are \"still\\r\\nlife\" and rather shadowy: we do not see the Bedfordshire and\\r\\nLincolnshire mansions, the summer houses where (as she observes with\\r\\ndemure relish when the danger is over) Mr. B. was \"very naughty;\" even\\r\\nthe pond where, if she had been another sort of girl, the drame might\\r\\nhave become real tragedy. Fielding does not take very much more trouble\\r\\nand yet somehow we do see it all, with a little help from our own\\r\\nimaginations perhaps, but on his suggestion and start. Especially the\\r\\noutdoor life and scenes—the inn-yards and the high roads and the downs\\r\\nby night or day; the pig-sty where poor Adams is the victim of live\\r\\npigs and the public-house kitchen where he succumbs to a by-product of\\r\\ndead ones—these are all real for us.\\nBut most of all is the regular progress of vivification visible in the\\r\\ndialogue. This, as we have seen, had been the very weakest point of the\\r\\nweakness of almost all (we might say of all) English novels up to the\\r\\nclose of the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Richardson had\\r\\ndone a great deal for it: but it was impossible that, on his method, it\\r\\nshould not, for the most part, be languid, or at any rate long-winded.\\r\\nHere again Fielding spirits the thing up—oxygenates and ozonises the\\r\\natmosphere: while, in even fuller measure than his predecessor and\\r\\nvictim, he recognises the efficacy of dialogue as the revealer of\\r\\ncharacter. He has, assisted no doubt by Shakespeare and his own dramatic\\r\\npractice, discovered that you do not want volumes of it to do the\\r\\nbusiness—that single moments and single sentences will do that business\\r\\nat times, if they are used in the proper way.\\nIn short, Fielding here used his reluctant and indignant forerunner as a\\r\\nspring-board, whence to attain heights which that forerunner could never\\r\\nhave reached: he \"stood upon his shoulders\" in the most cavalier but\\r\\nalso the most successful fashion. In the novel as Richardson knew it and\\r\\nwas thinking of it, when he began Pamela, you were, as a rule, in an\\r\\nartificial world altogether—a world artificial with an artificiality\\r\\nonly faintly and occasionally touched with any reality at all. In\\r\\nPamela itself there is perhaps nothing, and certainly not much, that\\r\\nis wholly unreal: but the reality is treated and rendered in an\\r\\nartificial way. In Joseph Andrews, though its professed genesis and\\r\\nprocedure are artificial too, you break away at once from serious\\r\\nartifice. These are all real people who do real things in a real way\\r\\nnow, as they did nearly two hundred years ago: however much dress, and\\r\\nspeech, and manners may have changed. And we are told of their doings in\\r\\na real way, too. Exactly how the teller knew it we do not know: but we\\r\\ndo not think of this at all. And on the other hand there is no perpetual\\r\\nreminder of art, like the letter-ending and beginning, to disturb or\\r\\nalloy the once and gladly accepted \"suspension of disbelief.\"\\nA slight digression may not be improper here. Even in their own days,\\r\\nwhen the gros mot was much less shocking than it is now, there was a\\r\\ngeneral notion—which has more or less persisted, in spite of all\\r\\nchanges of fashion in this respect, and exists even now when licence of\\r\\nsubject as distinguished from phrase has to a great extent\\r\\nreturned—that Fielding is more \"coarse,\" more \"improper,\" and so forth\\r\\nthan Richardson. As a matter of fact, neither admits positively indecent\\r\\nlanguage—that had gone out, except in the outskirts and fringes of\\r\\nEnglish literature, generations earlier. But I am much mistaken if there\\r\\nare not in Richardson more than a few scenes and situations the\\r\\n\"impropriety\" of which positively exceeds anything in Fielding.\\r\\nNaturally one does not give indications: but readers may be pretty\\r\\nconfident about the fact. The comparative \"bloodlessness,\" however—the\\r\\nabsence of life and colour in the earlier and older writer—acts as a\\r\\nsort of veil to them.\\nYet (to return to larger and purer air), however much one may admire\\r\\nJoseph Andrews, the kind of parasitic representation which it allows\\r\\nitself, and the absence of any attempt to give an original story tells\\r\\nagainst it. And it may, in any case, be regarded as showing that the\\r\\nnovelist, even yet, was hugging the shore or allowing himself to be\\r\\ntaken in tow—that he did not dare to launch out into the deep and\\r\\ntrust to his own sails and the wind of nature to propel him—to his own\\r\\nwits and soul to guide. Even Fielding\\'s next venture—the wonderful and\\r\\nalmost unique venture of Jonathan Wild—leaves some objection of this\\r\\nsort possible, though, for myself, I should never dream of admitting it.\\r\\nJonathan was (so much the worse for human nature) a real person: and the\\r\\noutlines of his story—if not the actual details—are given partly by\\r\\nhis actual life, partly by Gay\\'s Beggar\\'s Opera and its sequel.\\r\\nMoreover, the whole marvellous little book has a purpose—the purpose of\\r\\nsatire on false ideas of greatness, historical and political. The\\r\\ninvention and the art of the writer are not even yet allowed frank and\\r\\nfree course.\\nBut though criticism will allow this, it will, if it be competent and\\r\\ncourageous, allow no deduction to be made from the other greatness of\\r\\nthis little masterpiece. It has never been popular; it is never likely\\r\\nto be popular; and one may almost say that it is sincerely to be hoped\\r\\nthat it never will be popular. For if it were, either all the world\\r\\nwould be scoundrels, which would be a pity: or all the world would be\\r\\nphilosophers and persons of taste, in which case it would be impossible,\\r\\nas the famous story has it, to \"look down on one\\'s fellow-creatures from\\r\\na proper elevation.\" It really is a novel and a remarkable one—superior\\r\\neven to Vanity Fair, according to Thackeray\\'s own definition, as a\\r\\ndelineation of \"a set of people living without God in the world.\" But it\\r\\nis even more (and here its only parallel is A Tale of a Tub, which is\\r\\nmore desultory and much more of a fatrasie or salmagundy of odds and\\r\\nends) a masterpiece and quintessential example of irony. Irony had come\\r\\nin with the plain prose style, without which it is almost impossible:\\r\\nand not merely Swift but others had done great things with it. It is,\\r\\nhowever, only here that it reaches the quintessence just spoken of with\\r\\na coherent and substantive purpose to serve as vehicle for it. It is\\r\\npossibly too strong for most people\\'s taste: and one may admit that, for\\r\\nanything like frequent enjoyment, it wants a certain admixture of the\\r\\nfantastic in its various senses—after the method of Voltaire in one\\r\\nway, of Beckford in another, of Peacock in a third, of Disraeli in a\\r\\nfourth—to make it acceptable to more than a very few. But it shows,\\r\\neven from our present limited point of view, of what immense and exalted\\r\\napplication the novel-method was capable: and it shows also the\\r\\nastonishing powers of its author. \"Genial,\" in the usual sense, it\\r\\ncertainly cannot be called; in the proper sense as equalling \"what is\\r\\nthe production of genius\" there are few books which deserve the term\\r\\nbetter. But it is an exercise in a by-way of the novel road-system,\\r\\nthough an early proof of the fact that such by-ways are endlessly open.\\nBut the time was coming, though it did not (and could hardly) come very\\r\\nquickly, when Fielding was to discard all kinds of adventitious aids and\\r\\nsuggestions—all crutches, spring-boards, go-carts, tugs, patterns,\\r\\ntracings—and go his own way—and the Way of the Novel—with no guidance\\r\\nbut something of the example of Cervantes directly and Shakespeare\\r\\nindirectly among the moderns, and of the poetic fiction-writers of old.\\r\\nIt is perfectly clear that he had thought widely (and perhaps had read\\r\\nnot a little) on the subject of literary criticism, in a sense not\\r\\ncommon in his day, and that the thinking had led him to a conception of\\r\\nthe \"prose epic\" which, though it might have been partly (not wholly by\\r\\nany means) pieced out of the Italian and Spanish critics of the late\\r\\nsixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, had never been worked out as\\r\\na complete theory, much less applied in practice and to prose. The\\r\\nProse Epic aims at—and in Fielding\\'s case has been generally admitted\\r\\nto have hit—something like the classical unity of main action. But it\\r\\nborrows from the romance-idea the liberty of a large accretion and\\r\\ndivagation of minor and accessory plot:—not the mere \"episode\" of the\\r\\nancients, but the true minor plot of Shakespeare. It assumes,\\r\\nnecessarily and once for all, the licence of tragi-comedy, in that sense\\r\\nof the term in which Much Ado About Nothing and A Winter\\'s Tale are\\r\\ntragi-comedies, and in which Othello itself might have been made one.\\r\\nAnd it follows further in the wake of the Shakespearean drama by\\r\\ninsisting far more largely than ancient literature of any kind, and far\\r\\nmore than any modern up to its date except drama had done, on the\\r\\nimportance of Character. Description and dialogue are rather subordinate\\r\\nto these things than on a level with them—but they are still further\\r\\nworked out than before. And there is a new element—perhaps suggested by\\r\\nthe parabasis of ancient comedy, but, it may be, more directly by the\\r\\npeculiar method of Swift in A Tale of a Tub. At various places in his\\r\\nnarrative, but especially at the beginnings of books and chapters,\\r\\nFielding as it were \"calls a halt\" and addresses his readers on matters\\r\\nmore or less relevant to the story, but rather in the manner of a\\r\\ncommentator and scholiast upon it than as actual parts of it. Of this\\r\\nmore later: for the immediate purpose is to survey and not to criticise.\\nThe result of all this was Tom Jones—by practically universal consent\\r\\none of the capital books of English literature. It is unnecessary to\\r\\nrecapitulate the famous praises of Gibbon, of Coleridge, of Byron, and\\r\\nof others: and it is only necessary to deal briefly with the complaints\\r\\nwhich, if they have never found such monumental expression as the\\r\\npraises, have been sometimes widely entertained. These objections—as\\r\\nregards interest—fasten partly on the address-digressions, partly on\\r\\nthe great inset-episode of \"The Man of the Hill:\" as regards morality on\\r\\na certain alleged looseness of principle in that respect throughout, and\\r\\nespecially on the licence of conduct accorded to the hero himself and\\r\\nthe almost entire absence of punishment for it. As for the first, \"The\\r\\nMan of the Hill\" was partly a concession to the fancy of the time for\\r\\nsuch things, partly a following of such actual examples as Fielding\\r\\nadmitted—for it need hardly be said that the inset-episode, of no or\\r\\nvery slight connection with the story, is common both in the ancients\\r\\nand in Cervantes, while it is to be found as long after Fielding as in\\r\\nthe early novel-work of Dickens. The digression-openings are at least as\\r\\nsatisfactory to some as they are unsatisfactory to others; it is even\\r\\ndoubtful whether they annoy anybody half so much as they have delighted\\r\\nsome excellent judges. The other point is well worn: but the wearing has\\r\\nnot taken off its awkwardness and unsavouriness. Difference of habit and\\r\\nmanners at the time will account for much: but the wiser apologists will\\r\\nsimply say that Fielding\\'s attitude to certain deviations from the\\r\\nstrict moral law was undoubtedly very indulgent, provided that such\\r\\ndeviations were unaccompanied by the graver and more detestable vices of\\r\\ncruelty, treachery, and fraud—that to vice which was accompanied by\\r\\nthese blacker crimes he was utterly merciless; and that if he is thus\\r\\nrather exposed to the charge of \"compounding by damning\"—in the famous\\r\\nphrase—the things that he damned admit of no excuse and those that he\\r\\ncompounded for have been leniently dealt with by all but the sternest\\r\\nmoralists.\\nSuch things are, however (in the admirable French sense),\\nmisères—wretched petty cavils and shallows of criticism. The only\\r\\nsensible thing to do is to launch out with Fielding into that deep and\\r\\nopen sea of human character and fate which he dared so gloriously.\\r\\nDuring the curious phase of literary opinion which the last twenty years\\r\\nor so have seen, it has apparently been discovered by some people that\\r\\nhis scheme of human thought and feeling is too simple—\"toylike\" I think\\r\\nthey call it—in comparison with that, say, of Count Tolstoi or of Mr.\\r\\nMeredith, that modern practice has reached a finer technique than his or\\r\\neven than that of his greatest follower, Thackeray. Far be it from the\\r\\npresent writer to say, or to insinuate, anything disrespectful of the\\r\\ngreat moderns who have lately left us. Yet it may be said without the\\r\\nslightest disrespect to them that the unfavourable comparison is mainly\\r\\na revival of Johnson\\'s mistake as to Fielding and Richardson. It is,\\r\\nhowever, something more—for it comes also from a failure to estimate\\r\\naright the parabasis-openings which have been more than once referred\\r\\nto. These passages do not perhaps exhibit the by-work and the process in\\r\\nthe conspicuous skeleton-clock fashion which their critics admire and\\r\\ndesire, but they contain an amount of acute and profound exploration of\\r\\nhuman nature which it would be difficult to match and impossible to\\r\\nsurpass elsewhere: while the results of Fielding\\'s working, of his\\r\\n\"toylike\" scheme, are remarkable toys indeed—toys which, if we regard\\r\\nthem as such, must surely strike us as rather uncanny. One is sometimes\\r\\nconstrained to think that it is perhaps not much more difficult to make\\r\\nthan to recognise a thoroughly live character. It certainly must be very\\r\\ndifficult to do the latter if there is any considerable number of\\r\\npersons who are unable to do it in the case of almost every one of the\\r\\npersonages of Tom Jones. With one possible exception they are all\\r\\nalive—even more so than those of Joseph Andrews and with a less\\r\\npeculiar and limited liveliness than those of Jonathan Wild. But it\\r\\ncertainly is curious that as the one good man of Jonathan, Heartfree,\\r\\nis the least alive of its personages, so the one bad man of Tom,\\r\\nBlifil, occupies the same position.\\nThe result of this variety and abundance of life is an even more than\\r\\ncorresponding opportunity for enjoyment. This enjoyment may arise in\\r\\ndifferent persons from different sources. The much praised and seldom\\r\\ncavilled at unity and completeness of the story may appeal to some.\\r\\nThere are others who are inclined towards elaborate plots as Sam Weller\\r\\nwas to the \"\\'rig\\'nal\" of his subpoena. It was a \"gratifyin\\' sort o\\'\\r\\nthing, and eased his mind\" to be aware of its existence, and that was\\r\\nall. These latter find their sources of enjoyment elsewhere, but\\r\\neverywhere else. The abundance and the vividness of character-presentation;\\r\\nthe liveliness and the abundance of the staging of that character; the\\r\\nvariety of scene and incident—all most properly connected with the plot,\\r\\nbut capable of existing and of being felt without it; the human dialogue;\\r\\nthe admirable phrase in that dialogue and out of it, in the digressions, in\\r\\nthe narrative, above, and through, and about, and below it all—these\\r\\nthings and others (for it is practically impossible to exhaust the\\r\\ncatalogue) fill up the cup to the brim, and keep it full, for the\\r\\nborn lover of the special novel-pleasure.\\nIn one point only was Fielding a little unfortunate perhaps: and even\\r\\nhere the \"perhaps\" has to be underlined. He came just before the end of\\r\\na series of almost imperceptible changes in ordinary English speech\\r\\nwhich brought about something like a stationary state. His maligner and\\r\\nonly slightly younger contemporary, Horace Walpole, in some of his\\r\\nletters, writes in a fashion which, putting mere slang aside, has hardly\\r\\nany difference from that of to-day. Fielding still uses \"hath\" for \"has\"\\r\\nand a few other things which seem archaic, not to students of literature\\r\\nbut to the general. In the same way dress, manners, etc., though much\\r\\nmore picturesque, were by that fact distinguished from those of almost\\r\\nthe whole nineteenth century and the twentieth as far as it has gone:\\r\\nwhile incidents were, even in ordinary life, still usual which have long\\r\\nceased to be so. In this way the immense advance—greater than was made\\r\\nby any one else till Miss Austen—that he made in the pure novel of this\\r\\nordinary life may be missed. But the intrinsic magnificence, interest,\\r\\nnature, abundance of Tom Jones can only be missed by those who were\\r\\npredestined to miss them. It is tempting—but the temptation must be\\r\\nresisted—to enliven these pages with an abstract of its astonishing\\r\\n\"biograph-panorama.\" But nothing save itself can do it justice. \"Take\\r\\nand read\" is the only wise advice.\\nNo such general agreement has been reached in respect of Fielding\\'s last\\r\\nnovel, Amelia. The author\\'s great adversary, Johnson—an adversary\\r\\nwhose hostility was due partly to generous and grateful personal\\r\\nrelations with Richardson, partly to political disagreement (for\\r\\nFielding was certainly \"a vile Whig\"), but most of all perhaps to a sort\\r\\nof horrified recoil from the novelist\\'s easy handling of temptations\\r\\nwhich were no easy matter to his critic—was nearly if not quite\\r\\npropitiated by it: and the enthusiasm for it of such a \"cynic\" as\\r\\nThackeray is well known. Of the very few persons whom it would not be\\r\\nridiculous to name with these, Scott—whose competence in criticising\\r\\nhis own art is one of the most wonderful though the least generally\\r\\nrecognised things about him—inclines, in the interesting\\r\\nIntroduction-Dialogue to The Fortunes of Nigel, to put it on a level\\r\\nwith Tom Jones itself as a perfectly constructed novel. But modern\\r\\ncriticism has, rightly or wrongly, been more dubious. Amelia is almost\\r\\ntoo perfect: her very forgiveness (it has been suggested) would be more\\r\\ninteresting if she had not almost completely shut her eyes to there\\r\\nbeing anything to forgive. Her husband seems to us to prolong the\\r\\nirresponsibility of youth, which was pardonable in Tom, to a period of\\r\\nlife and to circumstances of enforced responsibility which make us\\r\\nrather decline to honour the drafts he draws; and he is also a little\\r\\nbit of a fool, which Tom, to do him justice, is not, though he is\\r\\nsomething of a scatterbrain. Dr. Harrison, whose alternate wrath and\\r\\nreconciliation supply the most important springs of the plot, is, though\\r\\na natural, a rather unreasonable person. The \"total impression\" has even\\r\\nbeen pronounced by some people to be a little dull. What there is of\\r\\ntruth in these criticisms and others (which it would be long even to\\r\\nsummarise) may perhaps be put briefly under two heads. It is never so\\r\\neasy to arouse interest in virtue as it is in vice: or in weak and\\r\\nwatered vice as in vice rectified (or unrectified) to full strength.\\r\\nAnd the old requirement of \"the quest\" is one which will hardly be\\r\\ndispensed with. Here (for we know perfectly well that Amelia\\'s virtue is\\r\\nin no danger) there is no quest, except that of the fortune which ought\\r\\nto be hers, which at last comes to her husband, and which we are told\\r\\n(and hope rather doubtfully) that husband had at last been taught—by\\r\\nthe Fool\\'s Tutor, Experience—not utterly to throw away. But this\\r\\nfortune drops in half casually at the last by a series of stage\\r\\naccidents, not ill-machined by any means, but not very particularly\\r\\ninteresting.\\nSuch, however, are the criticisms which Fielding himself has taught\\r\\npeople to make, by the very excellence of his success in the earlier\\r\\nnovels: and there is a certain comparative and relative validity in\\r\\nthem. But consider Amelia in itself, and they begin to look, if not\\r\\npositively unfounded, rather unimportant. Once more, the astonishing\\r\\ntruth and variety of scene and character make themselves felt—even more\\r\\nfelt—even felt in new directions. The opening prison scenes exceed\\r\\nanything earlier even in Fielding himself, much more in any one else, as\\r\\nexamples of the presentation of the unfamiliar. Miss Matthews—whom\\r\\nFielding has probably abstained from working out as much as he might\\r\\nlest she should, from the literary point of view, obscure Amelia—is a\\r\\nmarvellous outline; Colonels James and Bath are perfectly finished\\r\\nstudies of ordinary and extraordinary \"character\" in the stage sense. No\\r\\nnovel even of the author\\'s is fuller of vignettes—little pictures of\\r\\naction and behaviour, of manners and society, which are not in the least\\r\\nirrelevant to the general story, but on the contrary extra-illustrate\\r\\nand carry it out.\\nWhile, therefore, we must in no way recede from the position above\\r\\nadopted in regard to Richardson, we may quite consistently accord an\\r\\neven higher place to Fielding. He relieved the novel of the tyranny and\\r\\nconstraint of the Letter; he took it out of the rut of confinement to a\\r\\nsingle or a very limited class of subjects—for the themes of Pamela\\r\\nand Clarissa to a very large extent, of Pamela and Grandison to a\\r\\nconsiderable one, and of all three to an extent not small, are\\r\\npractically the same. He gave it altogether a larger, wider, higher,\\r\\ndeeper range. He infused in it (or restored to it) the refreshing and\\r\\npreserving element of humour. He peopled it with a great crowd of lively\\r\\nand interesting characters—endowed, almost without regard to their\\r\\ntechnical \"position in life,\" with unlimited possession of life. He\\r\\nshook up its pillows, and bustled its business arrangements. He first\\r\\ngave it—for in matter of prose style Richardson has few resources, and\\r\\nthose rather respectable than transporting, and decidedly\\r\\nmonotonous—the attractions of pure literature in form, and in pretty\\r\\nvarious form. He also gave it the attraction of pure comedy, only\\r\\nlegitimately salted with farce, in such personages as Adams and\\r\\nPartridge; of lower and more farcical, but still admirable comedy in\\r\\nSlipslop and Trulliber and Squire Western; of comedy almost romantic and\\r\\ncertainly charming in Sophia; of domestic drama in Amelia; of satiric\\r\\nportraiture in a hundred figures from the cousins (respectable and\\r\\ndisreputable), Miss Western and Lady Bellaston, downwards. He stocked it\\r\\nwith infinite miscellanies of personage, and scene, and picture, and\\r\\nphrase. As has happened in one or two other cases, he carried, at least\\r\\nin the opinion of the present writer, the particular art as far as it\\r\\nwill go. He did not indeed leave nothing for his successors to do—on\\r\\nthe contrary he left them in a sense everything—for he showed how\\r\\neverything could be done. But if he has sometimes been equalled, he has\\r\\nnever been surpassed: and it is not easy to see even how he can be\\r\\nsurpassed. For as his greatest follower has it somewhere, though not of\\r\\nhim, \"You cannot beat the best, you know.\"\\nOne point only remains, the handling of which may complete a treatment\\r\\nwhich is designedly kept down in detail. It has been hinted at already,\\r\\nperhaps more than once, but has not been brought out. This is the\\r\\nenormous range of suggestion in Fielding—the innumerable doors which\\r\\nstand open in his ample room, and lead from it to other chambers and\\r\\ncorridors of the endless palace of Novel-Romance. This had most\\r\\nemphatically not been the case with his predecessor: for Richardson,\\r\\nexcept in point of mere length, showed little power of expatiation, kept\\r\\nhimself very much to the same ground and round, and was not likely to\\r\\nteach anybody else to make excursions. Indeed Fielding\\'s breaking away\\r\\nin Joseph Andrews is an allegory in itself. But, at least with pupils\\r\\nand followers of any wits, there was not even any need of such breaking\\r\\naway from himself, though no doubt there are in existence many dull and\\r\\nslavish attempts to follow his work, especially Tom Jones. \"Find it\\r\\nout for yourself\"—the great English motto which in the day of England\\'s\\r\\nglory was the motto of her men of learning as well as of her men of\\r\\nbusiness, of her artists as well as of her craftsmen—might have been\\r\\nFielding\\'s: but he supplemented it with infinite finger-pointings\\r\\ntowards the various things that might be found out. Almost every kind of\\r\\nnovel exists—potentially—in his Four (the custom of leaving out\\r\\nJonathan Wild should be wholly abrogated), though of course they do\\r\\nnot themselves illustrate or carry out at length many of the kinds that\\r\\nthey thus suggest.\\nAnd in fact it could not be otherwise: because, as has been pointed out,\\r\\nwhile Fielding had no inconsiderable command of the Book of Literature,\\r\\nhe turned over by day and night the larger, the more difficult, but\\r\\nstill the greater Book of Life. Not merely quicquid agunt homines, but\\r\\nquicquid sentiunt, quicquid cogitant, whatever they love and hate,\\r\\nwhatever they desire or decline—all these things are the subjects of\\r\\nhis own books: and the range of subject which they suggest to others is\\r\\nthus of necessity inexhaustible.\\nIf there have been some who denied or failed to recognise his greatness,\\r\\nit must be because he has played on these unwary ones the same trick\\r\\nthat Garrick, in an immortal scene, played on his own Partridge. There\\r\\nis so little parade about Fielding (for even the opening addresses are\\r\\nnot parade to these good people: they may disconcert or even disgust,\\r\\nbut they do not dazzle them), that his characters and his scenes look\\r\\ncommonplace. They feel sure that \"if they had seen a ghost they would\\r\\nhave looked in the very same manner and done just as he does.\" They are\\r\\nsure that, in the scene with Gertrude, \"Lord, help them! any man—that\\r\\nis any good man—that had such a mother would have done exactly the\\r\\nsame.\"\\nWell! in a way no doubt they are right; and one may imitate the wisdom\\r\\nof Mr. Jones on the original occasion in not saying much more to them.\\r\\nTo others, of course, this is the very miracle of art—a miracle, as far\\r\\nas the art of prose fiction is concerned, achieved in its fullness for\\r\\npractically the first time. This is the true mimesis—the re-creation\\r\\nor fresh creation of fictitious reality. There were in Fielding\\'s time,\\r\\nand probably ever since have been, those who thought him \"low;\" there\\r\\nwere, even in his own time, and have been in varying, but on the whole\\r\\nrather increased, degree since, those who thought him immoral: there\\r\\nappear to be some who think (or would like it to be thought that they\\r\\nthink) him commonplace and obvious. Now, as it happens, all these\\r\\ncharges have been brought against Nature too. To embellish, and correct,\\r\\nand heighten, and extra-decorate her was not Fielding\\'s way: but to\\r\\nfollow, and to interpret, and to take up her own processes with results\\r\\nuncommonly like her own. That is his immense glory to all those who can\\r\\nrealise and understand it: and as for the others we must let them alone,\\r\\njoined to their own idols.\\nIn passing to the third of this great quartette, we make a little\\r\\ndescent, but not much of one, while the new peak to which we come is\\r\\nwell defined and separated, with characters and outlines all its own. It\\r\\nmay be doubted whether any competent critic not, like Scott, bribed by\\r\\ncompatriotism, ever put Smollett above Fielding, or even on a level with\\r\\nhim. Thackeray, in one of the most inspired moments of his rather\\r\\nirregularly-inspired criticism, remarks, \"I fancy he did not invent\\r\\nmuch,\" and this of itself would refer him to a lower class. The writer\\r\\nof fiction is not to refuse suggestion from his experience; on the\\r\\ncontrary, he will do so at his peril, and will hardly by any possibility\\r\\nescape shipwreck unless his line is the purely fantastic. But if he\\r\\nrelies solely, or too much, on such experience, though he may be quite\\r\\nsuccessful, his success will be subject to discount, bound to pay\\r\\nroyalty to experience itself. It is pretty certain that most of\\r\\nSmollett\\'s most successful things, from Roderick Random to Humphry\\r\\nClinker, and in those two capital books, perhaps, most of all, kept\\r\\nvery close to actual experience, and sometimes merely reported it.\\nThis, however, is only a comparative drawback; it is in a sense a\\r\\npositive merit; and it is connected, in a very intimate way, with the\\r\\ngeneral character of Smollett\\'s novel-method. This is, to a great\\r\\nextent, a reaction or relapse towards the picaresque style. Smollett may\\r\\nhave translated both Cervantes and Le Sage; he certainly translated the\\r\\nlatter: and it was Le Sage who in any case had the greatest influence\\r\\nover him. Now the picaresque method is not exactly untrue to ordinary\\r\\nlife: on the contrary, as we have seen, it was a powerful schoolmaster\\r\\nto bring the novel thereto. But it subjects the scenes of ordinary life\\r\\nto a peculiar process of sifting: and when it has got what it wants, it\\r\\nproceeds to heighten them and \"touch them up\" in its own peculiar\\r\\nmanner of decoration. This is Smollett\\'s method throughout, even in that\\r\\nsingular pastiche of Don Quixote itself, Sir Launcelot Greaves,\\r\\nwhich certainly was not his happiest conception, but which has had\\r\\nrather hard measure.\\nAs used by him it has singular merits, and communicates to at least\\r\\nthree of his five books (The Adventures of an Atom is deliberately\\r\\nexcluded as not really a novel at all) a certain \"liveliness\" which,\\r\\nthough it is not the lifelikeness of Fielding, is a great attraction.\\r\\nHe showed it first in Roderick Random (1748), which appeared a little\\r\\nbefore Tom Jones, and was actually taken by some as the work of the\\r\\nsame author. It would be not much more just to take Roderick as\\r\\nSmollett\\'s deliberate presentment of himself than to apply the same\\r\\nconstruction to Marryat\\'s not very dissimilar, but more unlucky, coup\\r\\nd\\'essai of Frank Mildmay. But it is certain that there was something,\\r\\nthough exactly how much has never been determined, of the author\\'s\\r\\nfamily history in the earliest part, a great deal of his experiences on\\r\\nboard ship in the middle, and probably not a little, though less, of his\\r\\nfortunes in Bath and London towards the end. As a single source of\\r\\ninterest and popularity, no doubt, the principal place must be given to\\r\\nthe naval part of the book. Important as the English navy had been, for\\r\\nnearly two centuries if not for much longer, it had never played any\\r\\ngreat part in literature, though it had furnished some caricatured and\\r\\nrather conventional sketches. There is something more in a play, The\\r\\nFair Quaker of Deal, by Charles Shadwell, nephew or son of Dryden\\'s\\r\\nvictim, but this was only of third or fourth rate literary value, and an\\r\\nisolated example to boot. The causes of the neglect have been set forth\\r\\nby many writers from Macaulay downwards, and need not be discussed here;\\r\\nthe fact is certain. Smollett\\'s employment of \"the service\" as a\\r\\nsubject may have been, consciously and intentionally, only one of those\\r\\nutilisings of personal experience of which we have spoken. But really it\\r\\nwas an instance of the great fact that the novelist, on the instigation\\r\\nmainly of Fielding himself, was beginning to take all actual life to be\\r\\nhis province.\\nSmollett brought to his work peculiar powers, the chief of which was a\\r\\nvery remarkable one, and almost as much \"improved on\" Fielding as\\r\\nFielding\\'s exercise of it was improved on Richardson—that of providing\\r\\nhis characters and scenes with accessories. Roderick is not only a much\\r\\nmore disagreeable person than Tom, but he is much less of a person:\\r\\nand Strap, though (vice versâ) rather a better fellow than Partridge,\\r\\nis a much fainter and more washed-out character. But in mere interest of\\r\\nstory and accessories the journey of Roderick and Strap to London is\\r\\nquite the equal, and perhaps the superior, of that of Tom and his\\r\\nhanger-on after we once leave Upton, where the interest is of a kind\\r\\nthat Smollett could not reach. It is probable that Fielding might, if he\\r\\nhad chosen, have made the prison in Amelia as horribly and\\r\\ndisgustingly realistic (to use a horrible and disgusting word) as the\\r\\nship in Roderick, but he at any rate did not choose. Moreover\\r\\nSmollett, himself a member of one of the less predominant partners of\\r\\nthe British and Irish partnership, perhaps for that reason hit on\\r\\nutilising the difference of these partners (after a fashion which had\\r\\nnever been seen since Shakespeare) in the Welshman Morgan. As far as\\r\\nmere plot goes, he enters into no competition whatever with either\\r\\nFielding or Richardson: the picaresque model did not require that he\\r\\nshould. When Roderick has made use of his friends, knocked down his\\r\\nenemies, and generally elbowed and shoved his way through the crowd of\\r\\nadventures long enough, Narcissa and her fortune are not so much the\\r\\nreward of his exertions as a stock and convenient method of putting an\\r\\nend to the account of them. The customer has been served with a\\r\\nsufficient amount of the commodity he demands: and the scissors are\\r\\napplied, the canister shut up, the tap turned off. It almost results—it\\r\\ncertainly coincides—that some of the minor characters, and some of the\\r\\nminor scenes, are much more vivid than the hero (the heroine is almost\\r\\nan absolute nonentity) and the whole story. The curate and the exciseman\\r\\nin the ninth chapter are, by common consent, among Smollett\\'s greatest\\r\\ntriumphs; but the curate might be excommunicated and the exciseman\\r\\nexcised without anybody who read the book perceiving the slightest gap\\r\\nor missing link, as far as the story is concerned.\\nSmollett\\'s second venture, Peregrine Pickle (1751), was more\\r\\nambitious, perhaps rose higher in parts, but undoubtedly contained even\\r\\nmore doubtful and inferior matter. No one can justly blame him, though\\r\\nany one may most justly refrain from praising, from the general point of\\r\\nview, as regards the \"insets\" of Miss Williams\\'s story in Roderick and\\r\\nof that of Lady Vane here. From that point of view they range with the\\r\\n\"Man of the Hill\" in Tom Jones, and in the first case at least, though\\r\\nmost certainly not in the second, have more justification of connection\\r\\nwith the central story. He may so far underlie the charge of error of\\r\\njudgment, but nothing worse. Unluckily the \"Lady Vane\" insertion was, to\\r\\na practical certainty, a commercial not an artistic transaction: and\\r\\nboth here and elsewhere Smollett carried his already large licence to\\r\\nthe extent of something like positive pornography. He is in fact one of\\r\\nthe few writers of real eminence who have been forced to Bowdlerise\\r\\nthemselves. Further, there would be more excuse for the most offensive\\r\\npart of Peregrine if it were not half plagiarism of the main\\r\\nsituations of Pamela and Clarissa: if Smollett had not deprived his\\r\\nhero of all the excuses which, even in the view of some of the most\\r\\nrespectable characters of Pamela, attached to the conduct of Mr. B.;\\r\\nand if he had not vulgarised Lovelace out of any possible attribution of\\r\\n\"regality,\" except of being what the time would have called King of the\\r\\nBlack Guard. As for Tom Jones, he does not come into comparison with\\r\\n\"Perry\" at all, and he would doubtless have been most willing and\\r\\nable—competent physically as well as morally—to administer the proper\\r\\npunishment to that young ruffian by drubbing him within an inch of his\\r\\nlife.\\nThese, no doubt, are grave drawbacks: but the racy fun of the book\\r\\nalmost atones for them: and the exaltation of the naval element of\\r\\nRoderick which one finds here in Trunnion and Hatchway and Pipes\\r\\ncarries the balance quite to the other side. This is the case even\\r\\nwithout, but much more with, the taking into account of Smollett\\'s usual\\r\\nirregular and almost irrelevant bonuses, such as the dinner after the\\r\\nfashion of the ancients and the rest. No: Peregrine Pickle can never\\r\\nbe thrown to the wolves, even to the most respectable and moral of these\\r\\nanimals in the most imposing as well as ravening of attitudes. English\\r\\nLiterature cannot do without it.\\nWithout Ferdinand Count Fathom (1753) many people have thought that\\r\\nEnglish Literature could do perfectly well: and without going quite so\\r\\nfar, one may acknowledge that perhaps a shift could be made. The idea of\\r\\nre-transferring the method (in the first place at any rate) to foreign\\r\\nparts was not a bad one, and it may be observed that by far the best\\r\\nportion of Fathom is thus occupied. Not a few of these opening\\r\\npassages are excellent: and Fathom\\'s mother, if not a person, is an\\r\\nexcellent type: it is probable that the writer knew the kind well. But\\r\\nhis unhappy tendency to enter for the same stakes as his great\\r\\nforerunners makes it almost impossible not to compare Ferdinand Fathom\\r\\nwith Jonathan Wild: and the effect is very damaging to the Count. Much\\r\\nof the book is dull: and Fathom\\'s conversation is (to adopt a cant word)\\r\\nextremely unconvincing. The fact seems to be that Smollett had run his\\r\\npicaresque vein dry, as far as it connected itself with mere rascality\\r\\nof various kinds, and he did well to close it. He had published three\\r\\nnovels in five years: he waited seven before his next, and then eleven\\r\\nmore before his last.\\nA qualified apology has been hinted above for Sir Launcelot Greaves.\\r\\nIt is undoubtedly evidence of the greatness of Don Quixote that there\\r\\nshould have been so many direct imitations of it by persons of genius\\r\\nand talent: but this particular instance is unfortunate to the verge of\\r\\nthe preposterous, if not over it. The eighteenth century was indeed\\r\\nalmost the capital time of English eccentricity: and it was also a time\\r\\nof licence which sometimes looked very like lawlessness. But its\\r\\neccentricities were not at this special period romantic: and its\\r\\nlawlessness was rather abuse of law than wholesale neglect of it. A\\r\\nrascally attorney or a stony-hearted creditor might inflict great\\r\\nhardship under the laws affecting money: and a brutal or tyrannical\\r\\nsquire might do the same under those affecting the tenure or the\\r\\nenjoyment of house or land. \"Persons of quality\" might go very far. But\\r\\neven a person of quality, if he took to riding about the country in\\r\\ncomplete steel, assaulting the lieges, and setting up a sort of\\r\\ncadi-justice of his own in opposition to the king\\'s, would probably\\r\\nhave been brought pretty rapidly, if not to the recovery of his senses,\\r\\nto the loss of his liberty. Nor, with rare exceptions, are the\\r\\nsubordinate or incidental humours of the first class. But I have always\\r\\nthought that the opening passage more than entitles the book to an\\r\\nhonourable place in the history of English fiction. I do not know where\\r\\nto look, before it, for such an \"interior\"—such a complete Dutch\\r\\npicture of room and furniture and accessories generally. Even so learned\\r\\na critic as the late M. Brunetière thought that things of the kind were\\r\\nnot older than Balzac. I have known English readers, not ignorant, who\\r\\nthought they were scarcely older than Dickens. Dickens, however,\\r\\nundoubtedly took them from Smollett, of whom we know that he was an\\r\\nearly and enthusiastic admirer: and Scott, who has them much earlier\\r\\nthan Dickens, not improbably was in some degree indebted for them to his\\r\\ncountryman. At any rate in that countryman they are: and you will not\\r\\nfind a much better example of them anywhere than this of the\\r\\ninn-kitchen. But apart from it, and from a few other things of the same\\r\\nor similar kinds, there is little to be said for the book. The divine\\r\\nAurelia especially is almost more shadowy than the divine Narcissa and\\r\\nthe divine Emilia: and can claim no sort of sistership in personality\\r\\nwith Amelia or Sophia, even with Clarissa or Pamela. In fact, up to this\\r\\ntime Smollett\\'s women—save in the case of Fathom\\'s hell-cat of a\\r\\nmother, and one or two more who are \"minors\"—have done absolutely\\r\\nnothing for his books. It was to be quite otherwise in the last and\\r\\nbest, though even here the heroine en titre is hardly, even though we\\r\\nhave her own letters to body her out, more substantial than her elder\\r\\nsisters. But Lydia, though the ingénue, is not the real heroine of\\r\\nthis book: her aunt and her aunt\\'s maid divide that position between\\r\\nthem.\\nA sufficiently ungracious critic may, if he chooses, see in Smollett\\'s\\r\\nfalling back on the letter-plan for Humphry Clinker (1771) an\\r\\nadditional proof of that deficiency in strictly inventive faculty which\\r\\nhas been noticed. The more generous \"judge by results\" will hardly care\\r\\nto consider so curiously in the case of such a masterpiece. For a\\r\\nmasterpiece it really is. The comparative absence of \"character\" in the\\r\\nhigher and literary sense as contrasted with \"character-parts\" in the\\r\\ntechnical meaning of the theatre has been admitted in the other books.\\r\\nHere, with the aid of the letters, it is amply supplied, or perhaps (to\\r\\nspeak with extreme critical closeness) the character-parts are turned\\r\\ninto characters by this means. There is no stint, because of the\\r\\nprovision of this higher interest, of the miscellaneous fun and\\r\\n\"business\" which Smollett had always supplied so lavishly out of his\\r\\nexperience, his observation, and, if not his invention, his combining\\r\\nfaculty. And there is the setting of interior and exterior \"furniture\"\\r\\nwhich has been also referred to. Abundant as is the information which\\r\\nthe eighteenth century has given us as to its justly beloved place of\\r\\npilgrimage, Bath, there is nothing livelier than the Bath scenes here,\\r\\nfrom Chesterfield to Miss Austen, and few things, if any, so vivid and\\r\\ndetailed. So it is with Clifton earlier, with London later, with\\r\\nScotland last of all, and with the journeys connecting them. Yet these\\r\\nthings are mere hors d\\'oeuvre, pickles, sauces, condiments, beside the\\r\\nsolid character-food of the Brambles and Melfords, of Winifred Jenkins\\r\\nand of the redoubtable Lismahago. That there is no exaggeration or\\r\\ncaricature cannot, of course, be said. It was not Smollett\\'s notion of\\r\\nart to present the elaborate academies of Richardson, or the almost\\r\\nuncanny duplications of Nature which Fielding could achieve. He must\\r\\nembolden, in fact grotesque, the line; heighten, in fact splash and\\r\\nplaster, the colour. But he has not left Nature behind here: he has only\\r\\nput her in a higher light.\\nOne means of doing so has been condemned in him, as in others, as in its\\r\\ngreat earlier master, Swift, and its greatest later one, Thackeray, by\\r\\nsome purists. They call it cheap and inartistic: but this is mere\\r\\npedantry and prudery. Mis-spelling is not a thing to be employed every\\r\\nday or for every purpose: if you do that, you get into the ineffably\\r\\ndreary monotony which distinguishes the common comic journalist. But\\r\\nthrown in occasionally, and in the proper place, it gives an excellent\\r\\nzest: and it has seldom been employed—never, except in the two\\r\\ninstances quoted—better than in the cases of Tabitha Bramble and her\\r\\nmaid. For it is employed in the only legitimate way, that of zest, not\\r\\nsubstance. Tabitha and Winifred would still be triumphs of\\r\\ncharacterisation of a certain kind if they wrote as correctly as Uncle\\r\\nMatthew or Nephew Jery. Further, Lismahago is a bolder and a much less\\r\\ncaricatured utilising of the \"national\" resource than Morgan. If\\r\\nSmollett had not been a perfectly undaunted, as well as a not very\\r\\namiable, person he would hardly have dared to \"lacess the thistle\" in\\r\\nthis fashion. But there are few sensible Scotsmen nowadays who would not\\r\\nagree with that most sensible, as well as greatest, of their\\r\\ncompatriots, Sir Walter Scott, in acknowledging the justice (comic\\r\\nemphasis granted) of the twitch, and the truth of the grip, at that\\r\\nformidable plant. The way in which Smollett mixes up actual living\\r\\npersons, by their own names, with his fictitious characters may strike\\r\\nus as odd: but there is, for the most part, nothing offensive in it,\\r\\nand in fact, except a little of his apparently inevitable indulgence in\\r\\nnasty detail, there is nothing at all offensive in the book. The\\r\\ncontrast of its general tone with that especially of his first two; the\\r\\nsoftening and mellowing of the general presentation—is very remarkable\\r\\nin a man of undoubtedly not very gentle disposition who had long\\r\\nsuffered from extremely bad health, and whose chief original works\\r\\nrecently—the Journey and the Adventures—had been, the first a\\r\\ntissue of grumbles, the second an outburst of savagery. But though the\\r\\ngrumbles recur in Matthew Bramble\\'s mouth, they become merely humorous\\r\\nthere: and there is practically no savagery at all. Leghorn, it has been\\r\\nobserved more than once, was in a fashion a Land of Beulah: a \"season of\\r\\ncalm weather\" had set in for a rather stormy life just before the end.\\nWhatever may be his defects (and from the mere point of view of Momus\\r\\nprobably a larger number may be found in him than either in Richardson\\r\\nor in Fielding), Smollett well deserves an almost equal place with them\\r\\nin the history of the novel. Richardson, though he had found the\\r\\nuniversal as far as certain aspects of it in humanity are concerned, had\\r\\nconfined it within a very narrow space, or particular envelope, in tone\\r\\nand temper: the fact that he has been called \"stifling,\" though the\\r\\nepithet may not be entirely just, is almost sufficient evidence of this.\\r\\nFielding had taken the novel into a far larger air and, as has been said\\r\\nalready, there was hardly anything to which his method might not lead,\\r\\nand in which it would not be effective. But he had been exclusively\\r\\nEnglish in externals: and the result is that, to this day, he has had\\r\\nless influence abroad than perhaps any English writer of equal genius\\r\\nand than some of far less.6 Smollett, by his remarkable utilisation\\r\\nof the characteristics of the other members of Magna-Britannia; by his\\r\\nexcursions into foreign European and even transatlantic scenery, had\\r\\nwidened the external if not the internal prospect; and had done perhaps\\r\\neven more by that chance-medley, as it perhaps was, of attention to the\\r\\nstill more internal detail which was to be of such importance in the\\r\\nnovel to come. Taking the three together (not without due allowance for\\r\\nthe contemporary, if mainly imitative, developments which will be\\r\\ndescribed in the next chapter), they had put prose fiction in a position\\r\\nwhich it had not attained, even in Spain earlier, even in France at more\\r\\nor less the same time: and had entirely antiquated, on the one hand, the\\r\\nmere fabliau or novella—the story of a single limited situation—on\\r\\nthe other, the discursive romance with little plot and next to no\\r\\ncharacter. One great further development, impossible at this time, of\\r\\nthe larger novel, the historical, waited for Scott: but even this was\\r\\nsoon, though very awkwardly, tried. It could not yet be born because the\\r\\nhistoric sense which was its necessary begetter hardly existed, and\\r\\nbecause the provision of historic matter for this sense to work on was\\r\\nrather scanty. But it is scarcely extravagant to say that it is more\\r\\ndifficult to conceive even Scott doing what he did without Richardson,\\r\\nFielding, and Smollett before him, than it is to believe that, with\\r\\nthese predecessors, somebody like Scott was bound to come.\\nGreat, however, as the three are, there is no need of any \"injustice to\\r\\nIreland\"—little as Ireland really has to claim in Sterne\\'s merit or\\r\\ndemerit. He is not a fifth wheel to the coach by any means: he is the\\r\\nfourth and almost the necessary one. In Richardson, Fielding, and\\r\\nSmollett the general character and possibilities of the novel had been\\r\\nshown, with the exception just noted: and indeed hardly with that\\r\\nexception, because they showed the way clearly to it. But its almost\\r\\nillimitable particular capabilities remained unshown, or shown only in\\r\\nFielding\\'s half extraneous divagations, and in earlier things like the\\r\\nwork of Swift. Sterne took it up in the spirit of one who wished to\\r\\nexhibit these capabilities; and did exhibit them signally in more than\\r\\none or two ways. He showed how the novel could present, in refreshed\\r\\nform, the fatrasie, the pillar-to-post miscellany, of which Rabelais\\r\\nhad perhaps given the greatest example possible, but of which there were\\r\\nnumerous minor examples in French. He showed how it could be made, not\\r\\nmerely to present humorous situations, but to exhibit a special kind of\\r\\nhumour itself—to make the writer as it were the hero without his ever\\r\\nappearing as character in Tristram, or to humorise autobiography as in\\r\\nthe Sentimental Journey. And last of all (whether it was his greatest\\r\\nachievement or not is matter of opinion), he showed the novel of purpose\\r\\nin a form specially appealing to his contemporaries—the purpose being\\r\\nto exhibit, glorify, luxuriate in the exhibition of, sentiment or\\r\\n\"sensibility.\" In none of these things was he wholly original; though\\r\\nthe perpetual upbraiding of \"plagiarism\" is a little unintelligent.\\r\\nRabelais, not to mention others, had preceded him, and far excelled him,\\r\\nin the fatrasie; Swift in the humour-novel; two generations of\\r\\nFrenchmen and Frenchwomen in the \"sensibility\" kind. But he brought all\\r\\ntogether and adjusted the English novel, actually to them, potentially\\r\\nto much else.\\nTo find fault with his two famous books is almost contemptibly easy. The\\r\\nplagiarism which, if not found out at once, was found out very soon, is\\r\\nthe least of these: in fact hardly a fault at all. The indecency, which\\r\\nwas found out at once, and which drew a creditable and not in the\\r\\nleast Tartuffian protest from Warburton, is a far more serious\\r\\nmatter—not so much because of the licence in subject as because of the\\r\\nunwholesome and sniggering tone. The sentimentality is very often simply\\r\\nmaudlin, almost always tiresome to us, and in very, very few\\r\\ncases justified by brilliant success even in its own very doubtful\\r\\nkind. Most questionable of all, perhaps, is the merely mechanical\\r\\nmountebankery—the blanks, and the dashes, and the rows of stops, the\\r\\nblack pages and the marbled pages which he employs to force a guffaw\\r\\nfrom his readers. The abstinence from any central story in Tristram is\\r\\none of those dubious pieces of artifice which may possibly show the\\r\\nartist\\'s independence of the usual attractions of story-telling, but may\\r\\nalso suggest to the churlish the question whether his invention would\\r\\nhave supplied him with any story to tell; and the continual asides and\\r\\nhalts and parenthetic divagations in the Journey are not quite free\\r\\nfrom the same suggestion. In fact if you \"can see a church by daylight\"\\r\\nyou certainly want no piercing vision, and no artificial assistance of\\r\\nlight or lens, to discover the faults of this very unedifying churchman.\\nBut he remains, for all that, a genius; and one of the great figures in\\r\\nour history. There is to his credit in general, as has been already\\r\\npointed out, the great asset of having indicated, and in two notable\\r\\ninstances patterned, the out-of-the-way novel—the novel eccentric,\\r\\nparticular, individual. There is to that credit still more the\\r\\nbrilliancy of the two specimens themselves in spite of their faults;\\r\\ntheir effectiveness in the literature of delight; the great powers of a\\r\\nkind more or less peculiar to the artist which they show, and the power,\\r\\nperhaps still greater, which they display in the actually general and\\r\\nordinary lines of the novel, though adapted to this extraordinary use.\\nFor though it pleased Sterne to anticipate the knife-grinder\\'s innocent\\r\\nconfession, \"Story? God bless you! I have none to tell, sir!\" in a\\r\\nsardonic paraphrase of half a score of volumes, he actually possessed\\r\\nthe narrative faculty in an extraordinary degree. He does not merely\\r\\nshow this in his famous inset short stories, accomplished as these are:\\r\\nhe achieves a much greater marvel in the way in which he makes his\\r\\nfatrasies as it were novels. After one or two, brief but certainly not\\r\\ntedious, volumes of the Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, you know\\r\\nthat you are being cheated, and are going to be: at the end you know\\r\\nstill more certainly that you have been. You have had nothing of the\\r\\n\"Life\" but a great deal round rather than about the birth, and a few\\r\\nequivocal, merely glanced at, and utterly unco-ordinated incidents\\r\\nlater. If you have had any \"opinions\" they have been chiefly those of\\r\\nMr. Tristram Shandy\\'s father and other members of his family, or those\\r\\nof its friends and circle, or of those shadowy personages outside the\\r\\npretended story, such as Eugenius and Yorick, besides a few discourses\\r\\nwhich drop the slightest pretension of being Shandean or Tristramic and\\r\\nare plainly and simply the author\\'s. In the Journey there is more\\r\\nunity; but it is, quite frankly, the unity of the temperament of that\\r\\nauthor himself. The incidents—sentimental, whimsical, fie-fie—have no\\r\\nother connection or tendency than the fact that they occur to the\\r\\n\"gentleman in the black silk smalls\" and furnish him with figures as it\\r\\nwere for his performance. Yet you are held in a way in which nothing\\r\\nbut the romance or the novel ever does hold you. The thing is a\\r\\nμυθοϛ ἄμυθοϛ—story without story-end, without story-beginning,\\r\\nwithout story-connection or middle: but a story for all that. A\\r\\ndangerous precedent, perhaps; but a great accomplishment: and, even as\\r\\na precedent, the leader of a very remarkable company. In not a few\\r\\nnoteworthy later books—in a very much greater number of parts of later\\r\\nbooks—as we take our hats off to the success we are saluting not a new\\r\\nbut an old friend, and that friend Sterne.\\nOn the second great count—character—Sterne\\'s record is still more\\r\\ndistinguished: and here there is no legerdemain about the matter. There\\r\\nis a consensus of all sound opinion to the effect that my Uncle Toby is\\r\\nan absolute triumph—even among those who think that, as in the case of\\r\\nColonel Newcome later, it would have been possible to achieve that\\r\\ntriumph without letting his simplicity run so near to something less\\r\\nattractive. It is not the sentiment that is here to blame, because\\r\\nSterne has luckily not forgotten (as he has in the case of his dead\\r\\ndonkeys and his live Marias) that humour is the only thing that will\\r\\nkeep such sentiment from turning mawkish, if not even rancid; and that\\r\\nthe antiseptic effect will not be achieved by keeping your humour and\\r\\nyour sentiment in separate boxes. Trim is even better: he is indeed next\\r\\nto Sancho—and perhaps Sam Weller—the greatest of all \"followers\" in\\r\\nthe novel: he supplies the only class-figure in which Sterne perhaps\\r\\nbeats Fielding himself. About Walter Shandy there is more room for\\r\\ndifference: and it is possible to contend that, great as he is, he is\\r\\nnot complete—that he is something of a \"humour\" in the old one-sided\\r\\nand over-emphasised Jonsonian sense. Nothing that he does or says\\r\\nmisbecomes him: but a good deal that he does not do and say might be\\r\\nadded with advantage, in order to give us the portrait of a whole as\\r\\nwell as a live man. As for the other male characters, Sterne\\'s plan\\r\\nexcused him—as it did not quite in Mr. Shandy\\'s case—from making them\\r\\nmore than sketches and shadows. But what uncommonly lively sketches and\\r\\nshadows they are!\\nSterne\\'s unlucky failing prevented him in most cases from touching the\\r\\nwomen off with a clean brush: but the quality of liveness pertains to\\r\\nthem in almost a higher measure: and perhaps testifies even more\\r\\nstrongly to his almost uncanny faculty of communicating it by touches\\r\\nwhich are not always unclean and are sometimes slight to an astonishing\\r\\ndegree. Even that shadow of a shade \"My dear, dear Jenny\" has a\\r\\nsuggestion of verity about her which has shocked and fluttered some: the\\r\\nmaids of the Shandean household, the grisettes and peasant girls and\\r\\nladies of the Journey, have flesh which is not made of paper, and\\r\\nblood that is certainly not ink. And the peculiarity extends to his two\\r\\nchief named heroines, Mrs. Shandy and the Widow. Never were any two\\r\\nfemale personages more unceremoniously treated in the way of scanty and\\r\\nincidental appearance. Never were any personages of scanty and\\r\\nincidental appearance made more alive and more female.\\nHis details and accessories of all kinds, descriptive, literary, and\\r\\nother, would give subject for a separate chapter; but we must turn (for\\r\\nthis chapter is already too long) to his phrase—in dialogue, narrative,\\r\\nwhatever you please to call it. For the fact is that these two things,\\r\\nand all others in which phrase and expression can be used, melt into\\r\\neach other with Sterne in a manner as \"flibberti-gibbety\" as most other\\r\\nthings about him. This phrase or expression is of course artificial to\\r\\nthe highest degree: and it is to it that the reproach of depending on\\r\\nmechanical aids chiefly applies. And yet laboriously figured, tricked,\\r\\nmachined as it is—easy as once more it may be to prove that it is\\r\\nartifice and not art—the fact remains that, not merely (perhaps not by\\r\\nany means chiefly) in the stock extract-pieces which everybody knows,\\r\\nbut almost everywhere, it is triumphant: and that English literature\\r\\nwould be seriously impoverished without it. Certainly never was there a\\r\\nstyle which more fully justified the definition given by Buffon, in\\r\\nSterne\\'s own time, of style as \"the very man.\" Falsetto, \"faking,\"\\r\\nvamping, shoddy—all manner of evil terms may be heaped upon it without\\r\\nthe possibility of completely clearing it from them. To some eyes it\\r\\nunderlies them most when it is most ambitious, as in the Le Fevre story\\r\\nand the diatribe against critics. It leaves the court with all manner of\\r\\nstains on its character. Only, once more, if it did not exist we should\\r\\nbe ignorant of more than one of the most remarkable possibilities of the\\r\\nEnglish language.\\nThus, in almost exactly the course of a technical generation—from the\\r\\nappearance of Pamela in 1740 to that of Humphry Clinker in 1771—the\\r\\nwain of the novel was solidly built, furnished with four main wheels to\\r\\nmove it, and set a-going to travel through the centuries. In a sense,\\r\\ninasmuch as Humphry Clinker itself, though Smollett\\'s best work, can\\r\\nhardly be said to show any absolutely new faculties, character, or\\r\\nmethod, the process was even accomplished in two-thirds of the time,\\r\\nbetween Pamela and Tristram Shandy. We shall see in the next chapter\\r\\nhow eagerly the examples were taken up: and how, long before Smollett\\r\\ndied, the novel of this and that kind had become one of the most\\r\\nprolific branches of literature. But, for the moment, the important\\r\\nthing is to repeat that it had been thoroughly and finally started on\\r\\nits high road, in general by Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett; in\\r\\nparticular and wayward but promising side-paths by Sterne.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\nTHE MINOR AND LATER EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL7\\nIt is at last beginning to be recognised in principle, though it is\\r\\nstill much too often forgotten in practice, that the minor work of a\\r\\ntime is at least as important as the major in determining general\\r\\nliterary characteristics and tendencies. Nor is this anywhere much more\\r\\nnoticeable than in regard to the present period of our present subject.\\r\\nThe direct influence of Richardson and Fielding was no doubt very great:\\r\\nbut the development of the novel during the middle and later century was\\r\\ntoo large and too various to be all mere imitation. As a result,\\r\\nhowever, of their influence, there certainly came over the whole kind a\\r\\nvery remarkable change. Even before them the nisus towards it, which\\r\\nhas been noticed in the chapter before the last, is observable enough.\\r\\nMrs. Manley\\'s rather famous New Atlantis (1709) has at least the form\\r\\nof a key-novel of the political sort: but the whole interest is in the\\r\\nkey and not in the novel, though the choice of the form is something.\\r\\nAnd the second, third, and fourth decades of the century saw other work\\r\\ntestifying to the vague and almost unconscious hankering after prose\\r\\nfiction which was becoming endemic. A couple of examples of this may be\\r\\ntreated, in passing, before we come to the work—not exactly of the\\r\\nfirst class in itself—of a writer who shows both the pre-Richardsonian\\r\\nand the post-Richardsonian phases of it most interestingly, and after a\\r\\nfashion to which there are few exact parallels.\\nA book, which counts here from the time of its appearance, and from a\\r\\ncertain oddity and air of \"key\" about it, rather than from much merit as\\r\\nliterature, or any as a story, is the Adventures of Gaudentio di Lucca\\r\\nby Simon Berington.8 It appeared in 1737, between Defoe and Swift on\\r\\nthe earlier, and Richardson on the later side, while the English world\\r\\nwas to the novel as an infant crying for the light—and the bottle—at\\r\\nonce. It begins and ends with adventures and discoveries of an ordinary\\r\\nromantic type. But the body consists of a revelation to certain Italian\\r\\nInquisitors (who are not at all of the lurid type familiar to the\\r\\nProtestant imagination, but most equitable and well-disposed as well as\\r\\npotent, grave, and reverend signers) of an unknown country of \"the Grand\\r\\nPophar\" in the centre of Africa. This country is civilised, but not yet\\r\\nChristianised: and the description of it of course gives room for the\\r\\nexercise of the familiar game of contrast—in this case not so much\\r\\nsatiric as didactic—with countries nearer home which are at least\\r\\nsupposed to be both civilised and Christian. It is a \"respectable\" book\\r\\nboth in the French and the English sense: but it is certainly not very\\r\\namusing, and cannot even be called very interesting in any way, save\\r\\nhistorically.\\nThe other example which we shall take is of even less intrinsic\\r\\nattraction: in fact it is a very poor thing. There are, however, more\\r\\nways than one in which corpora vilia are good for experiment and\\r\\nevidence: and we may find useful indications in the mere bookmaking of\\r\\nthe time. Lowndes, the fortunate publisher of Evelina, some dozen\\r\\nyears before that windfall came, had issued, or reissued, a collection\\r\\ncalled The Novelist and professedly containing The select novels of\\r\\nDr. Croxall [the ingenious author of The Fair Circassian and the part\\r\\ndestroyer of Hereford Cathedral] and other Polite Tales. The book is\\r\\nan unblushing if not an actually piratical compilation; sweeping\\r\\ntogether, with translations and adaptations published by Croxall himself\\r\\nat various times in the second quarter of the century and probably\\r\\nearlier, most of the short stories from the Spectator class of\\r\\nperiodical which had appeared during the past two-thirds of a century.\\r\\nMost of the rest are obvious (and very badly done) translations from the\\r\\nFrench and even from Cervantes\\' Exemplary Novels; seasoned with\\r\\npersonal and other anecdotes, so that the whole number of separate\\r\\narticles may exceed four-score. Of these a few are interesting attempts\\r\\nat the historical novel or novelette—short sketches of Mary Queen of\\r\\nScots (very sympathetic and evidently French in origin from the phrase\\r\\n\"a temple which was formerly a church\"), Jane Shore (an exquisitely\\r\\nabsurd piece of eighteenth-century middle-class modernising and\\r\\nmoralising), Essex, Buckingham, and other likely figures. There are cuts\\r\\nby the \"Van-somethings and Back-somethings\" of the time: and the whole,\\r\\nthough not worthy of anything better than the \"fourpenny box,\" is an\\r\\nevident symptom of popular taste. The sweetmeats or hors d\\'oeuvre of\\r\\nthe older caterings for that taste are here collected together to form a\\r\\npièce de résistance. It is true that The Novelist is only a true\\r\\ntitle in the older sense—that the pieces are novelle not \"novels\"\\r\\nproper. But they are fiction, or fact treated like fiction: and though\\r\\nthe popular taste itself was evidently ceasing to be satisfied with\\r\\nthese morsels and demanding a substantial joint, yet the substance was,\\r\\nafter all, the same.\\nWe rise higher, if not very high, with the novels of Mrs. Eliza Haywood\\r\\n(1693-1756), one of the damned of the Dunciad, but, like some of her\\r\\nfellows in that Inferno, by no means deserving hopeless reprobation.\\r\\nEvery one who has devoted any attention to the history of the novel, as\\r\\nwell as some who have merely considered it as a part of that of English\\r\\nliterature generally, has noticed the curious contrast between the\\r\\nearlier and the later novels of this writer. Betsy Thoughtless (1751)\\r\\nand Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy (1753) could, without much difficulty, be\\r\\ntransposed into novels of to-day. Idalia (1723) is of an entirely\\r\\ndifferent mood and scheme. It is a pure Behnesque nouvelle, merely\\r\\ndescribing the plots and outrage which ruin the heroine (The\\r\\nUnfortunate Mistress is the second title), but attempting no\\r\\ncharacter-drawing (the only hint at such a thing is that Idalia, instead\\r\\nof being a meek and suffering victim, is said to have a violent temper),\\r\\nand making not the slightest effort even to complete what story there\\r\\nis. For the thing breaks off with a sort of \"perhaps to be concluded\\r\\nin some next,\" about which we have not made up our minds. Very rarely\\r\\ndo we find such a curious combination or succession of styles so early:\\r\\nbut the novel, for pretty obvious reasons, seems to offer temptations to\\r\\nit and facilities for it.\\nFor Idalia\\'s above-named juniors, while not bad books to read for mere\\r\\namusement, have a very particular interest for the student of the\\r\\nhistory of the novel. Taken in connection with their author\\'s earlier\\r\\nwork, they illustrate, for the first time, a curious phenomenon which\\r\\nhas repeated itself often, notably in the case of Bulwer, and of a\\r\\nliving novelist who need not be named. This is that the novel, more\\r\\nalmost than any other kind of literature, seems to lend itself to what\\r\\nmay be called the timeserving or \"opportunism\" of craftsmanship—to\\r\\ncall out the adaptiveness and versatility of the artist. Betsy and\\r\\nJenny are so different from Idalia and her group that a critic of\\r\\nthe idle Separatist persuasion would, were it not for troublesome\\r\\ncertainties of fact, have no difficulty whatever in proving that they\\r\\nmust be by different authors. We know that they were not: and we know\\r\\nalso the reason of their dissimilarity—the fact that Pamela and her\\r\\nbrother and their groups ont passé par là.9 This fact is most\\r\\ninteresting: and it shows, among other things, that Mrs. Eliza Haywood\\r\\nwas a decidedly clever woman.\\nAt the same time the two books also show that she was not quite clever\\r\\nenough: and that she had not realised, as in fact hardly one of the\\r\\nminor novelists of this time did realise, the necessity of\\r\\nindividualising character. Betsy is both a nice and a good\\r\\ngirl—\"thoughtless\" up to specification, but no fool, perfectly\\r\\n\"straight\" though the reverse of prudish, generous, merry, lovable. But\\r\\nwith all these good qualities she is not quite a person. Jenny is, I\\r\\nthink, a little more of one, but still not quite—while the men and the\\r\\nother women are still less. Nor had Eliza mastered that practised knack\\r\\nof \"manners-painting\" which was to stand Fanny Burney, and many another\\r\\nafter her, in the stead of actual character-creation. Her situations are\\r\\noften very lively, if not exactly decorous; and they sometimes have a\\r\\nreal dramatic verisimilitude, for instance, the quarrel and\\r\\nreconciliation of the Lord and the Lady in Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy;\\r\\nbut the higher verisimilitude of prose fiction they lack. Neither again\\r\\n(though Smollett had given her a lead here) had she attained that power\\r\\nof setting and furnishing a scene which is so powerful a weapon in the\\r\\nnovelist\\'s armoury. Yet she had learnt much: and her later work would\\r\\nhave been almost a wonder in her own earlier time.\\nShe had even been preceded in the new line by one, and closely followed\\r\\nby another writer of her own sex, both of unblemished reputation, and\\r\\nperhaps her superiors in intellectual quality and accomplishment, though\\r\\nthey had less distinct novel-faculty. Sarah Fielding, the great\\r\\nnovelist\\'s sister, but herself one of Richardson\\'s literary seraglio,\\r\\nhad a good deal of her brother\\'s humour, but very little of his\\r\\nconstructive grasp of life. David Simple (1744), her best known work,\\r\\nthe Familiar Letters connected with it (to which Henry contributed),\\r\\nand The Governess display both the merit and the defect—but the\\r\\ndefect is more fatal to a novel than the merit is advantageous. Once\\r\\nmore—if the criticism has been repeated ad nauseam the occasions of\\r\\nit may be warranted to be much more nauseous in themselves—one looks up\\r\\nfor interest, and is not fed. \"The Adventures\" of David—whose progeny\\r\\nmust have been rapidly enriched and ennobled if Peter Simple was his\\r\\ndescendant—were \"in search of a Friend,\" and he came upon nobody in the\\r\\nleast like O\\'Brien. It was, in fact, too early or too late for a lady\\r\\nto write a thoroughly good novel. It had been possible in the days of\\r\\nMadeleine de Scudèry, and it became possible in the days of Frances\\r\\nBurney: but for some time before, in the days of Sarah Fielding, it was\\r\\nonly possible in the ways of Afra and of Mrs. Haywood, who, without any\\r\\nunjust stigma on them, can hardly be said to fulfil the idea of\\r\\nladyhood, as no doubt Miss Fielding did.\\nThere is an amusing and (in its context) just passage of Thackeray\\'s,\\r\\nin which he calls Charlotte Lennox, author of The Female Quixote\\r\\n(1752), a \"figment.\" But it would be unlucky if any one were thereby\\r\\nprevented from reading this work of the lady whom Johnson admired, and\\r\\nfor whom he made an all-night orgie of apple-pie and bay-leaves. Her\\r\\nbook, which from its heroine is also called Arabella, is clever and\\r\\nnot unamusing, though it errs (in accordance with the moral-critical\\r\\nprinciples of the time) by not merely satirising the \"heroic\" romances\\r\\nof the Gomberville-La Calprenède-Scudèry type, but solemnly discussing\\r\\nthem. Arabella, the romance-bitten daughter of a marquis, is, for all\\r\\nher delusion, or because of it, rather a charming creature. Her lover\\r\\nGlanville, his Richardsonian sister, and the inevitable bad Baronet (he\\r\\ncan hardly be called wicked, especially for a Baronet) are more\\r\\ncommonplace: and the thing would have been better as a rather long\\r\\nnouvelle than as a far from short novel. It alternately comes quite\\r\\nclose to its original (as in the intended burning of Arabella\\'s books)\\r\\nand goes entirely away from it, and neither as an imitation nor\\r\\nindependently is it as good as Graves\\'s Spiritual Quixote: but it is\\r\\nvery far from contemptible.\\nYet though the aptitude of women for novel-writing was thus early\\r\\nexemplified, it is not to be supposed that the majority of persons who\\r\\nfelt the new influences were of that sex. By far the larger number of\\r\\nthose who crowded to follow the Four were, like them, men.\\nThat not exactly credit to the Tory party, Dr. John Shebbeare, has had\\r\\nhis demerits in other ways excused to some extent on the score of\\r\\nLydia—whose surname, by the way, was \"Fairchild,\" not unknown in\\r\\nlater days of fiction. Even one who, if critical conscience would in\\r\\nany way permit it, would fain let the Tory dogs have a little the best\\r\\nof it, must, I fear, pronounce Lydia a very poor thing. Shebbeare, who\\r\\nwas a journalist, had the journalist faculty of \"letting everything go\\r\\nin\"—of taking as much as he could from Richardson, Fielding, Smollett,\\r\\netc., up to date (1755); and of throwing back to Afra for an interesting\\r\\nIndian, Canassatego. The book (like not a few other eighteenth-century\\r\\nnovels) has very elaborate chapter headings and very short chapters, so\\r\\nthat an immoral person can get up its matter pretty easily. A virtuous\\r\\none who reads it through will have to look to his virtue for reward. The\\r\\nirony is factitious and forced; the sentiment unappealing; the\\r\\ncoarseness quite destitute of Rabelaisian geniality; and the\\r\\nnomenclature may be sampled from \"the Countess of Liberal\" and \"Lord\\r\\nBeef.\" I believe Shebbeare was once pilloried for his politics. If it\\r\\nhad been for Lydia, I should not have protested.\\nThe next book to be mentioned is an agreeable change. Why Hazlitt\\r\\ncompared The Life of John Buncle (1756-1766) to Rabelais is a somewhat\\r\\nidle though perhaps not quite unanswerable question; the importance of\\r\\nthe book itself in the history of the English novel, which has sometimes\\r\\nbeen doubted or passed over, is by no means small. Its author, Thomas\\r\\nAmory (1691?-1788), was growing old when he wrote it and even when he\\r\\nprefaced it with a kind of Introduction, the Memoirs of several Ladies\\r\\n(1755). It is a sort of dream-exaggeration of an autobiography; at first\\r\\nsight, and not at first sight only, the wildest of farragos. The author\\r\\nrepresents himself as a disinherited son who is devoted, with equal\\r\\nenthusiasm, to matrimony, eating and drinking as much as he can of the\\r\\nbest things he can find, discussion of theological problems in a\\r\\n\"Christian-deist\" or Unitarian sense, \"natural philosophy\" in the vague\\r\\neighteenth-century meaning, and rambling—chiefly in the fell district\\r\\nwhich includes the borders of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Westmoreland,\\r\\n\"Bishopric\" (Durham), and Cumberland. With this district—which even\\r\\nnow, though seamed with roads and railways, does actually contain some\\r\\nof the wildest scenery of the island; which only forty years ago was\\r\\nmuch wilder; and which in Amory\\'s time was a howling wilderness in\\r\\nparts—he deals in the characteristic spirit of exaggeration which\\r\\nperhaps, as much as anything else, suggested Rabelais to Hazlitt. From\\r\\nMalham Cove and Hardraw Scar, through the Wild Boar Fell district to the\\r\\nhead of Teesdale, you can find at this moment rough and rugged scenery\\r\\nenough, some of which is actually recognisable when \"reduced\" from\\r\\nAmory\\'s extravagance. But that extravagance extends the distances from\\r\\nfurlongs to leagues; deepens the caverns from yards to furlongs; and\\r\\nexalts fell and scar into Alps and Andes. In the same way he has to\\r\\nmarry eight wives (not seven as has been usually, and even by the\\r\\npresent writer, said), who are distractingly beautiful and wonderfully\\r\\nwise, but who seldom live more than two years: and has a large number of\\r\\nchildren about whom he says nothing, \"because he has not observed in\\r\\nthem anything worth speaking about.\" The courtships are varied between\\r\\nabrupt embraces soon after introduction, and discussions on Hebrew,\\r\\nBabel, \"Christian-deism,\" and the binomial theorem. In the most\\r\\ninhospitable deserts, his man or boy10 is invariably able to produce\\r\\nfrom his wallet \"ham, tongue, potted blackcock, and a pint of cyder,\"\\r\\nwhile in more favourable circumstances Buncle takes his ease in his inn\\r\\nby consuming \"a pound of steak, a quart of green peas, two fine cuts of\\r\\nbread, a tankard of strong ale, and a pint of port\" and singing cheerful\\r\\nlove-ditties a few days after the death of an adored wife. He comes down\\r\\nthe side of precipices by a mysterious kind of pole-jumping—half a\\r\\ndozen fathoms at a drop with landing-places a yard wide—like a chamois\\r\\nor a rollicking Rocky Mountain ram. Every now and then he finds a\\r\\nskeleton, with a legend of instructive tenor, in a hermitage which he\\r\\nannexes: and almost infallibly, at the worst point of the wilderness,\\r\\nthere is an elegant country seat with an obliging old father and a\\r\\nlively heiress ready to take the place of the last removed charmer.\\nMad, however, as this sketch may sound, and certainly not quite sane as\\r\\nAmory may have been, there is a very great deal of method in his, and\\r\\nsome in its, madness. The flashes of shrewdness and the blocks of pretty\\r\\nsolid learning (Rabelaisian again) do not perhaps so much concern us:\\r\\nbut the book, ultra-eccentric as it is, does count for something in the\\r\\nhistory of the English novel. Its descriptions, rendered through a\\r\\nmagnifying glass as they are, have considerable power; and are quite\\r\\nunlike anything in prose fiction, and most things in prose literature,\\r\\nbefore it. In Buncle himself there is a sort of extra-natural,\\r\\n\"four-dimension\" nature and proportion which assert the novelist\\'s power\\r\\nmemorably:—if a John Buncle could exist, he would very probably be like\\r\\nAmory\\'s John Buncle. Above all, the book (let it be remembered that it\\r\\ncame before Tristram Shandy) is almost the beginning of the Eccentric\\r\\nNovel—not of the satiric-marvellous type which Cyrano and Swift had\\r\\nrevived from Lucian, but of a new, a modern, and a very English variety.\\r\\nBuncle is sometimes extraordinarily like Borrow (on whom he probably\\r\\nhad influence), and it would not be hard to arrange a very considerable\\r\\nspiritual succession for him, by no means deserving the uncomplimentary\\r\\nterms in which he dismisses his progeny in the flesh.\\nIf there is an almost preposterous cheerfulness about Buncle, the\\r\\nnecessary alternative can be amply supplied by the next book to which we\\r\\ncome. The curious way in which Johnson almost invariably managed to hit\\r\\nthe critical nail on the head is well illustrated by his remark to\\r\\nFrances Sheridan, author of the Memoirs of Miss Sydney Bid[d]ulph\\r\\n(1761), that he \"did not know whether she had a right, on moral\\r\\nprinciples, to make her readers suffer so much.\" Substitute \"æsthetic\"\\r\\nfor \"moral\" and \"heroine\" for \"readers,\" and the remark retains its\\r\\ntruth on another scheme of criticism, which Johnson was not ostensibly\\r\\nemploying, and which he might have violently denounced. The book, though\\r\\nwith its subsequent prolongation too long, is a powerful one: and though\\r\\nactually dedicated to Richardson and no doubt consciously owing much to\\r\\nhis influence, practically clears off the debt by its own earnings. But\\r\\nMiss Bidulph (she started with only one d, but acquired another),\\r\\nwhose journal to her beloved Cecilia supplies the matter and method of\\r\\nthe novel, is too persistently unlucky and ill-treated, without the\\r\\nsmallest fault of her own, for anything but really, not fictitiously,\\r\\nreal life. Her misfortunes spring from obeying her mother (but there was\\r\\nneither moral nor satire in this then), and husbands, lovers, rivals,\\r\\nrelations, connections—everybody—conspire to afflict her. Poetical\\r\\njustice has been much abused in both senses of that verb: Sydney\\r\\nBiddulph shows cause for it in the very act of neglect.\\nBut the eighteenth century, on the whole, loathed melancholy. The\\r\\nSpiritual Quixote (1772) of the Reverend Richard Graves (1715-1804)\\r\\nhas probably been a little injured by the ingenuous proclamation of\\r\\nindebtedness in the title. It is, however, an extremely clever and\\r\\namusing book: and one of the best of the many imitations of its\\r\\noriginal, which, indeed, it follows only on broad and practically\\r\\nindependent lines. During his long life (for more than half a century of\\r\\nwhich he was rector of Claverton near Bath) Graves knew many interesting\\r\\npersons, from Shenstone and Whitefield (with both of whom he was at\\r\\nPembroke College, Oxford, though he afterwards became a fellow of All\\r\\nSouls) to Malthus, who was a pupil of his; and he had some interesting\\r\\nprivate experiences. He wove a good deal that was personal into his\\r\\nnovel, which, as may easily be guessed, is a satire upon Methodism, and\\r\\nin which Whitefield is personally and not altogether favourably\\r\\nintroduced. But even on him Graves is by no means savage: while his\\r\\ntreatment of his hero, Geoffrey Wildgoose, a young Oxford man who,\\r\\nliving in retirement with his mother in the country, becomes an\\r\\nevangelist, very mainly from want of some more interesting occupation,\\r\\nis altogether good-humoured. Wildgoose promptly falls in love with a\\r\\nfascinating damsel-errant, Julia Townsend; and the various adventures,\\r\\nreligious, picaresque, and amatory, are embroiled and disembroiled with\\r\\nvery fair skill in character and fairer still in narrative. Nor is the\\r\\nSancho-Partridge of the piece, Jerry Tugwell, a cobbler (who thinks,\\r\\nthough he is very fond of his somewhat masterful wife, that a little\\r\\nabsence from her would not be unrefreshing), by any means a failure.\\r\\nBoth Scott and Dickens evidently knew Graves well,11 and knowledge of\\r\\nhim might with advantage be more general.\\nThe novels that have been noticed since those contrasted ones of Mrs.\\r\\nHaywood\\'s, which occupy a position by themselves, all possess a sort of\\r\\ntraditional fame; and cover (with the proper time allowed for the start\\r\\ngiven by Richardson and Fielding) nearly the same period of thirty\\r\\nyears—in this case 1744 (David Simple) to 1772 (The Spiritual\\r\\nQuixote)—which is covered by the novels of the great quartette\\r\\nthemselves. It would be possible to add a great many, and easy and not\\r\\ndisagreeable to the writer to dwell on a few. Of these few some are\\r\\nperhaps necessary. Frank Coventry\\'s Pompey the Little—an amusing\\r\\nsatirical novel with a pet dog for the title-giver and with the\\r\\npromising (but as a rule ill-handled) subject of university life treated\\r\\nearly—appeared in 1751—the same year which saw the much higher flight\\r\\n(the pun is in sense not words) of Peter Wilkins, by Robert Paltock of\\r\\nClement\\'s Inn, a person of whom practically nothing else is known. It\\r\\nwould be lucky for many people if they were thus singly yoked to\\r\\nhistory. It was once fashionable to dismiss Peter as a boy\\'s book,\\r\\nbecause it discovers a world of flying men and women, modelled partly on\\r\\nDefoe, partly on Swift; it has more recently been fashionable to hint a\\r\\nsneer at it as \"sentimental\" because of its presentment of a sort of\\r\\nfantastic and unconventional Amelia (who, it may be remembered, made her\\r\\nappearance in the same year) in the heroine Youwarkee. Persons who do\\r\\nnot care for fashion will perhaps sometimes agree that, though not\\r\\nexactly a masterpiece, it is rather a charming book. If anybody is\\r\\nsickened by its charm he may restore himself by a still better known\\r\\nstory which no one can accuse of charm or sentiment, though it is\\r\\nclever enough—Charles Johnstone\\'s Chrysal or The Adventures of a\\r\\nGuinea (1760). This, which is strongly Smollettian in more ways than\\r\\none, derives its chief notoriety from the way in which the scandalous\\r\\n(and perhaps partly fabulous) orgies of Medmenham Abbey are, like other\\r\\nscandalous and partly fabulous gossip of the time, brought in. But it\\r\\nis clever; though emphatically one of the books which \"leave a bad\\r\\ntaste in the mouth.\" Indeed about this time the novel, which even in\\r\\nclean hands allowed itself not a little freedom, took, in others,\\r\\nexcursions in the direction of the province of \"prohibited literature,\"\\r\\nand sometimes passed the border.\\nOne rather celebrated book, however, has not yet been mentioned: and it\\r\\nwill serve very well, with two others greater in every way, as usher to\\r\\na few general remarks on the weakness of this generation of minor\\r\\nnovelists. Between 1766 and 1770 Henry Brooke, an Irishman of position,\\r\\nfortune, and literary distinction in other ways, who was at the time of\\r\\nmore than middle age, published The Fool of Quality or The Adventures\\r\\nof Henry Earl of Morland. The hero is a sort of Grandison-Buncle, as\\r\\nproper though scarcely as priggish as the one, and as eccentric and\\r\\ndiscursive as the other; the story is chaos: the book is stuffed with\\r\\ndisquisitions on all sorts of moral, social, and political problems. It\\r\\nis excellently written; it is clear from it that Brooke (who was for a\\r\\ntime actually mad) did not belie the connection of great wits with\\r\\nmadness. But it is, perhaps, most valuable as an evidence of the\\r\\nunconquerable set of the time towards novel.\\nOf this, however, as of some other points, we have greater evidence\\r\\nstill in the shape of two books, each of them, as nothing else yet\\r\\nmentioned in this chapter can claim to be, a permanent and capital\\r\\ncontribution to English literature—Johnson\\'s Rasselas (1759) and\\r\\nGoldsmith\\'s Vicar of Wakefield (1766).\\nIt is not from the present writer that any one need look for an attempt\\r\\nto belittle Johnson: and there is no doubt (for the Lives of the Poets\\r\\nis but a bundle of essays) that Rasselas is Johnson\\'s greatest book.\\r\\nBut there may be, in some minds, as little doubt that attempts to defend\\r\\nit from the charge of not being a novel are only instances of that not\\r\\nwholly unamiable frenzy of eagerness to \"say not ditto to Mr. Burke\"\\r\\nwhich is characteristic of clever undergraduates, and of periods which\\r\\nare not quite of the greatest in literature. Rasselas is simply an\\r\\nextended and glorified moral apologue—an enlarged \"Vision of Mirza.\" It\\r\\nhas no real story; it has no real characters; its dialogue is \"talking\\r\\nbook;\" it indulges in some but not much description. It is in fact a\\r\\nprose Vanity of Human Wishes, admirably if somewhat stiffly arranged\\r\\nin form, and as true to life as life itself. You will have difficulty in\\r\\nfinding a wiser book anywhere; but although it is quite true that a\\r\\nnovel need not be foolish, wisdom is certainly not its determining\\r\\ndifferentia. Yet for our purposes Rasselas is almost as valuable as\\r\\nTom Jones itself: because it shows how imperative and wide-ranging was\\r\\nthe struggle towards production of this kind in prose. The book is\\r\\nreally—to adapt the quaint title of one of the preceding\\r\\ncentury—Johnson al Mondo: and at this time, when Johnson wanted to\\r\\ncommunicate his thoughts to the world in a popular form, we see that he\\r\\nchose the novel.\\nThe lesson is not so glaringly obvious in the Vicar of Wakefield,\\r\\nbecause this is a novel, and a very delightful one. The only point\\r\\nof direct contact with Rasselas is the knowledge of human\\r\\nnature, though in the one book this takes the form of melancholy\\r\\naphorism and apophthegm, in the other that of felicitous trait and\\r\\ndialogue-utterance. There is plenty of story, though this has not been\\r\\narranged so as to hit the taste of the martinet in \"fable;\" the book has\\r\\nendless character; the descriptions are Hogarth with less of peuple\\r\\nabout them; the dialogue is unsurpassable. Yet Goldsmith, untiring hack\\r\\nof genius as he was, wrote no other novel; evidently felt no particular\\r\\ncall or predilection for the style; would have been dramatist, poet,\\r\\nessayist with greater satisfaction to himself, though scarcely\\r\\n(satisfactory as he is in all these respects) to us. That he tried it at\\r\\nall can hardly be set down to anything else than the fact that the style\\r\\nwas popular: and his choice is one of the highest possible testimonies\\r\\nto the popularity of the style. Incidentally, of course, the Vicar has\\r\\nmore for us than this, because it indicates, as vividly as any of the\\r\\nwork of the great Four themselves, how high and various the capacities\\r\\nof the novel are—how in fact it can almost completely compete with and,\\r\\nfor a time, vanquish the drama on its own ground. Much of it, of\\r\\ncourse—the \"Fudge!\" scene between Mr. Burchell and the town ladies may\\r\\nbe taken as the first example that occurs—is drama, with all the\\r\\ncumbrous accessories of stage and scene and circumstance spared. One may\\r\\nalmost see that \"notice to quit,\" which (some will have it) has been,\\r\\nafter nearly a century and a half, served back again on the novel,\\r\\nserved by the Vicar of Wakefield on the drama.\\nAt the same time even the Vicar, though perhaps less than any other\\r\\nbook yet noticed in this chapter, illustrates the proposition to which\\r\\nwe have been leading up—that, outside the great quartette, and even to\\r\\na certain extent inside of it, the novel had not yet fully found its\\r\\nproper path—had still less made up its mind to walk freely and firmly\\r\\ntherein. Either it has some arrière pensée, some second purpose,\\r\\nbesides the simple attempt to interest and absorb by the artistic\\r\\nre-creation of real and ordinary life: or, without exactly doing this,\\r\\nit shows signs of mistrust and misgiving as to the sufficiency of such\\r\\nan appeal, and supplements it by the old tricks of the drama in\\r\\n\"revolution and discovery;\" by incident more or less out of the ordinary\\r\\ncourse; by satire, political, social, or personal; by philosophical\\r\\ndisquisition; by fantastic imagination—by this, that, and the other of\\r\\nthe fatal auxiliaries who always undo their unwise employers. Men want\\r\\nto write novels; and the public wants them to write novels; and supply\\r\\ndoes not fail desire and demand. There is a well-known locus classicus\\r\\nfrom which we know that, not long after the century had passed its\\r\\nmiddle, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Italy regularly received boxes of\\r\\nnovels from her daughter in England, and read them, eagerly though by no\\r\\nmeans uncritically, as became Fielding\\'s cousin and her ladyship\\'s self.\\r\\nBut while the kind had not conquered, and for a long time did not\\r\\nconquer, any high place in literature from the point of view of serious\\r\\ncriticism—while, now and long afterwards, novel-writing was the\\r\\nCinderella of the literary family, and novel-reading the inexhaustible\\r\\ntext for sermons on wasted, nay positively ill-spent, time—the\\r\\nnovelists themselves half justified their critics by frequent\\r\\nextravagance; by more frequent unreality; by undue licence pretty often;\\r\\nby digression and divagation still oftener. Except Fielding, hardly any\\r\\none had dared boldly to hold up the mirror to nature, and be content\\r\\nwith giving the reflection, in his own way, but with respect for it. For\\r\\neven Goldsmith, with infinite touches of nature, had not given quite a\\r\\nnatural whole, and even Johnson, though absolutely true, had failed to\\r\\naccommodate his truth to the requirements of the novel.\\nThe turning point in this direction of the kind was to be made by a\\r\\nperson far inferior in ability to any one of the great quartette, and in\\r\\na book which, as a book, cannot pretend to an equality with the worst\\r\\nof theirs—by a person indeed of less intellectual power, and in a book\\r\\nof less literary merit, than not a few of the persons and books just\\r\\nnoticed. There is something, no doubt, paradoxical in this: and the\\r\\nparadox is connected, both with a real quality of the subject and with a\\r\\nsurprising diversity of opinions about it. Frances Burney and her\\r\\nEvelina (1778), not to mention her subsequent works and her delightful\\r\\nDiary, have been the subject of a great deal of writing: but though\\r\\nmore than a hundred years—more indeed than a century and a\\r\\nquarter—have passed since the book insidiously took London by gradual\\r\\nstorm, it may, without too much presumption, be questioned whether\\r\\neither book or author has yet been finally or satisfactorily \"placed.\"\\r\\nThe immense advantage of not having a history, positively illustrated\\r\\nonce for all in Shakespeare, could hardly be negatively illustrated\\r\\nbetter than in Madame d\\'Arblay. She had the curious, and actually very\\r\\nunpleasant, experience of being selected for a position at court on the\\r\\nstrength of her literary achievements, of finding it intolerable, of\\r\\nbreaking down, and of never doing any really good work after her\\r\\nrelease, through much more than half of her long life. On this fact\\r\\ncritical biography has fastened almost exclusively. Macaulay, in one of\\r\\nhis most brilliant and best known essays, represents the world as having\\r\\nbeen deprived of unknown quantities of admirable work by the misplaced\\r\\nkindness, and the positive unkindness, of Queen Charlotte. Some have\\r\\nagreed with him, some have differed with him. Some, in one of the\\r\\nnatural if uncritical revulsions, have questioned whether even Evelina\\r\\nis a very remarkable book. Some, with human respect for the great names\\r\\nof its early admirers, have passed it over gingerly—not exactly as\\r\\nwilling to wound, but as quite afraid or reluctant to strike. Nay,\\r\\nactual critical evaluations of the novel-values of Miss Burney\\'s four\\r\\nattempts in novel-writing are very rare. I dare say there are other\\r\\npeople who have read The Wanderer through: but I never met any one who\\r\\nhad done so except (to quote Rossetti) myself: and I could not bring\\r\\nmyself, even on this occasion, to read it again. I doubt whether very\\r\\nmany now living have read Camilla. Even Cecilia requires an effort,\\r\\nand does not repay that effort very well. Only Evelina itself is\\r\\nlegible and relegible—for reasons which will be given presently. Yet\\r\\nCecilia was written shortly after Evelina, under the same stimulus\\r\\nof abundant and genial society, with no pressure except that of friendly\\r\\nencouragement and perhaps assistance, and long before the supposed\\r\\nblight of royal favour and royal exigences came upon its author. When\\r\\nCamilla was published she had been relieved from these exigences,\\r\\nthough not from that favour, for five years: and was a thoroughly happy\\r\\nwoman, rejoicing in husband and child. Even when the impossible\\r\\nWanderer was concocted, she had had ample leisure, had as yet incurred\\r\\nnone of her later domestic sorrows, and was assured of lavish recompense\\r\\nfor her (it must be said) absolutely worthless labours. Why this steady\\r\\ndeclension, with which, considering the character of Cecilia, the\\r\\ncourt sojourn can have had nothing to do? And admitting it, why still\\r\\nuphold, as the present writer does uphold, Evelina as one of the\\r\\npoints de repère of the English novel? Both questions shall be\\r\\nanswered in their order.\\nFrances Burney must have been, as we see not merely from external\\r\\ntestimony, but from the infallible witness of her own diary, a most\\r\\nengaging person to any one who could get over her shyness and her\\r\\nprudery:12 but she was only in a very limited sense a gifted one.\\r\\nMacaulay grants her a \"fine understanding;\" but even his own article\\r\\ncontradicts the statement, which is merely one of his exaggerations for\\r\\nthe sake of point. She had not a fine understanding: though she was\\r\\nneither silly nor stupid, her sense was altogether inferior to her\\r\\nsensibility. Although living in a most bookish circle she was, as\\r\\nMacaulay himself admits, almost illiterate: and (which he does not say)\\r\\nher comparative critical estimates of books, when she does give them,\\r\\nare merely contemptible. This harsh statement could be freely\\r\\nsubstantiated: but it is enough to say that, when a girl, she preferred\\r\\nsome forgotten rubbish called Henry and Frances to the Vicar of\\r\\nWakefield: and that, when a woman, she deliberately offended\\r\\nChateaubriand by praising the Itinéraire rather than the Génie du\\r\\nChristianisme, or Atala, or René, or Les Martyrs. She had very\\r\\nlittle inventive power; her best novel, Evelina, has no plot worth\\r\\nspeaking of. She never wrote really well. Even the Diary derives its\\r\\nwhole charm from the matter and the reportage. Evelina is tolerable\\r\\nstyle of the kind that has no style; Cecilia is pompous and\\r\\nJohnsonian; Camilla was stigmatised by the competent and affectionate\\r\\njudgment of Mrs. Delany as \"Gallicised;\" and The Wanderer is in a\\r\\nlingo which suggests the translation of an ill-written French original\\r\\nby a person who does not know English.\\nWhat then was it in Evelina, and in part in Cecilia (with a faint\\r\\nsurvival even into Camilla), which turned the heads of such a \"town\"\\r\\nas Johnson and Burke, Walpole and Windham, and many others—which, to\\r\\npersons who can see it, makes the books attractive to-day, and which\\r\\nshould always give their author a secure and distinguished place in the\\r\\ngreat torch-race of English fiction-writers? It is this—that Miss\\r\\nBurney had a quite marvellous faculty of taking impressions of actual\\r\\nspeech, manners, and to a certain extent character: that she had, at any\\r\\nrate for a time, a corresponding faculty of expressing, or at least\\r\\nreporting, her impressions. Next (and perhaps most of all) that she had\\r\\nthe luck to come at a moment when speech and manners were turning to the\\r\\nmodern; and lastly, that she was content, in parts of her work at any\\r\\nrate, to let her faculty of expression work, automatically and\\r\\nuninterfered with, on the impressions: and thereby give us record of\\r\\nthem for all time. Her acute critic \"Daddy\" Crisp lamented that we had\\r\\nnot had a series of recorders of successive tons [fashions] like\\r\\nFanny. But she was much more than a mere fashion-monger: and what has\\r\\nlasted best in her was not mere fashion. She could see and record life\\r\\nand nature: and she did so. Still, fashion had a good deal to do with\\r\\nit: and when her access to fashion and society ceased, the goodness of\\r\\nher work ceased likewise.\\nEven this gift, and this even in Evelina and the better parts of\\r\\nCecilia, she had not always with her. The sentimental parts of\\r\\nEvelina—the correspondence with Mr. Villars, the courtship with Lord\\r\\nOrville, and others—are very weak: and it cannot be said that Evelina\\r\\nherself, though she is a pleasant girl enough, gives the lie to Mr.\\r\\nPope\\'s libel about women. Cecilia has a little more individuality. But\\r\\nthe great strength of the former book lies in the admirable lower\\r\\nmiddle-class pictures of the Branghtons and Mr. Smith, whom Fanny had\\r\\nevidently studied from the life in the queer neighbourhood of Poland\\r\\nStreet: as also in the justness and verisimilitude of the picture of the\\r\\nsituation, which in different ways both books present—that of the\\r\\nintroduction of a young girl to the world.13 In these points, as in\\r\\nothers which there is neither space nor need to particularise, Miss\\r\\nBurney showed that she had hit upon—stumbled upon one may almost\\r\\nsay—the real principle and essence of the novel as distinguished from\\r\\nthe romance—its connection with actual ordinary life—life studied\\r\\nfreshly and directly \"from the life,\" and disguised and adulterated as\\r\\nlittle as possible by exceptional interests and incidents. It is\\r\\nscarcely too much to say that one great reason why the novel was so long\\r\\ncoming into existence was precisely this—that life and society so long\\r\\nremained subject to these exceptional interests and incidents. It is\\r\\nonly within the last century or so that the \"life of \\'mergency\" (to\\r\\nadapt Mr. Chucks slightly) ceased to be the ordinary life. Addison\\'s\\r\\n\"Dissenter\\'s Diary\" with its record of nothing but constitutionals and\\r\\nmarrow-bones, and Mr. Nisby\\'s opinions, has simply amused half a dozen\\r\\ngenerations. Yet, in a sense, it has nearly as much to do with the\\r\\nadvent of the novel as Sir Roger de Coverley himself. For these things\\r\\nare, not merely in an allegory, the subjects of the novel. Not so very\\r\\nmuch earlier Mr. Nisby would have had a chance of delivering his\\r\\nopinions on the scaffold: and his disciple would have had prison bread\\r\\nand water for marrow-bones and \"Brooks and Hellier.\" These would have\\r\\nbeen subjects for romance: the others were subjects for novel.\\nAll glory, therefore, be to Frances Burney; both that which her\\r\\ngenerous successor and superior gives her in Northanger Abbey, and\\r\\nmore also—for Miss Austen, naturally enough, was not taking the\\r\\nview-point of literary history. But it has been said that Fanny herself\\r\\npossessed her gift in two senses uncertainly—first, in that she did not\\r\\nvery clearly perceive what it was, and, secondly, in that she soon lost\\r\\ngrip of it. It is, therefore, not wonderful that few others caught the\\r\\ntrick from her for a long time—for indeed fully twenty years, till Miss\\r\\nEdgeworth made her appearance. But these twenty years were years of\\r\\nextreme fertility in novels of different sorts, while—a phenomenon that\\r\\noccurs not seldom—the older kind of fiction made a kind of rally at the\\r\\nvery time that the newer was at last solidly establishing itself. There\\r\\nwas, indeed, ample room for both. You cannot kill Romance: it would be a\\r\\nprofound misfortune, perhaps the profoundest that could befall the human\\r\\nrace, if you could. But the new romance was of rather a bastard kind,\\r\\nand it showed more of the bad blood than of the good till, by a curious\\r\\ncoincidence, Scott once more found the true strain, just about the same\\r\\ntime as that at which Miss Austen was making known the true strain of\\r\\nthe novel proper.\\nThis hybrid new romance had been stumbled upon more than a decade before\\r\\nFanny Burney in her turn stumbled upon the pure novel: and most people\\r\\nknow in what and by whom. To this day it is by no means easy to be\\r\\ncertain what Horace Walpole really meant to write, or thought he was\\r\\nwriting, in The Castle of Otranto (1764). His own references to his\\r\\nown writings are too much saturated with affectation and pose to make it\\r\\nsafe to draw any conclusions from them; there is little or no external\\r\\nevidence; and the book itself is rather a puzzle. Taking the Preface to\\r\\nthe second edition with a very large allowance of salt—the success of\\r\\nthe first before this preface makes double salting advisable—and\\r\\naccommodating it to the actual facts, one finds it hardly necessary to\\r\\ngo beyond the obvious and almost commonplace solution that The Castle\\r\\nof Otranto was simply the castle of Strawberry Hill itself with paper\\r\\nfor lath and ink for plaster—in other words, an effort to imitate\\r\\nsomething which the imitator more than half misunderstood. Of mediæval\\r\\nliterature proper, apart from chronicles and genealogies, Walpole knew\\r\\nnothing: and for its more precious features he had the dislike which\\r\\nsometimes accompanies ignorance. But he undoubtedly had positive\\r\\nliterary genius—flawed, alloyed, incomplete, uncritical of itself, but\\r\\nexisting: and this genius showed itself here. His paper-and-ink\\r\\n\"Strawberry\" is quite another guess structure from his lath-and-plaster\\r\\none. For itself in itself—for what it is—the present writer, though\\r\\nhe has striven earnestly and often for the sake of the great things that\\r\\nit did, has never been able to get up any affection or admiration. It\\r\\nis preposterous, desultory, tedious, clumsy, dull. But it made people\\r\\n(we know it on such excellent authority as Gray\\'s) shudder: and the\\r\\nshudder was exactly what they wanted—in every sense of the verb \"to\\r\\nwant.\" Moreover, quite independently of this shudder, it pointed the way\\r\\nto a wide, fertile, and delightful province of historical, social,\\r\\nliterary, and other matter which had long been neglected, and which\\r\\npeople had been assured was not worth exploring. Blair was just using,\\r\\nor about to use, \"any romance of chivalry\" as a hyperbolical\\r\\nexemplification of the contemptible in literature. Hume had been arguing\\r\\nagainst, and Voltaire was still sneering at, all sorts of superstition\\r\\nand supernaturalism. The common cant of criticism for generations had\\r\\nbeen that \"sense\" and \"reason\" were to be the only criteria. Walpole\\'s\\r\\negregious helmet dropped from no one knew (or knows) where on all these\\r\\nPhilistinisms: and squelched them. How it did this, why it did it, and\\r\\nso forth, one knows not much more than one knows why and how all the\\r\\nthings happened in the novel itself. Après coup, the author talked\\r\\nabout \"Shakespeare\" (of whom, by the way, he was anything but a fervent\\r\\nor thorough admirer) and the like. Shakespeare had, as Sir Walter\\r\\nRaleigh has well pointed out, uncommonly little to do with it. But\\r\\nShakespeare at least supplies us with an appropriate phrase for the\\r\\noccasion. The Castle of Otranto \"lay in\" Horace\\'s \"way, and he found\\r\\nit.\" And with it, though hardly in it, he found the New Romance.\\nIn Horace\\'s case also, as in that of Frances, though the success was\\r\\neven more momentous, the successors were slow and doubtful, though not\\r\\nquite so slow. In some dozen years Walpole read Miss Clara Reeve\\'s Old\\r\\nEnglish Baron (1777), and as in another celebrated case \"thought it a\\r\\nbore.\" It is rather a bore. It has more consecutiveness than\\r\\nOtranto, and escapes the absurdities of the copiously but clumsily\\r\\nused supernatural by administering it in a very minute dose. But there\\r\\nis not a spark of genius in it, whereas that spark, though sometimes\\r\\ncuriously wrapped up in ashes, was always present (Heaven knows where he\\r\\ngot it!) in Sir Robert\\'s youngest son. And the contagion spread. For\\r\\ngeneral and epidemic purposes it had to wait till the Germans had\\r\\ncarried it over the North Sea and sent it back again. For particular\\r\\nones, it found a new development in one of the most remarkable of all\\r\\nnovels, twenty years younger than Otranto, and a few years older than\\r\\nthe new outburst of the \"Gothic\" supernatural in the works of Anne\\r\\nRadcliffe and Mat Lewis.\\nVathek (1786) stands alone—almost independent even of its\\r\\nsponsors—it would be awkward to say godfathers—Hamilton and Voltaire;\\r\\napart likewise from such work as it, no doubt, in turn partly suggested\\r\\nto Peacock and to Disraeli. There is, perhaps, no one towards whom it is\\r\\nso tempting to play the idle game of retrospective Providence as towards\\r\\nthe describer of Batalha and Alcobaça, the creator of Nouronnihar and\\r\\nthe Hall of Eblis. Fonthill has had too many vicissitudes since\\r\\nBeckford, and Cintra is a far cry; but though his associations with Bath\\r\\nare later, it is still possible, in that oddly enchanted city, to get\\r\\nsomething of the mixed atmosphere—eighteenth century, nineteenth, and\\r\\nof centuries older and younger than either—which, tamisée in a\\r\\nmysterious fashion, surrounds this extraordinary little masterpiece.\\r\\nTake Beckford\\'s millions away; make him coin his wits to supply the want\\r\\nof them; and what would have been the result? Perhaps more Vatheks;\\r\\nperhaps things even better than Vathek;14 perhaps nothing at all. On\\r\\nthe whole, it is always wiser not to play Providence, in fact or fancy.\\r\\nAll that need be said is that Anthony Hamilton and Voltaire are\\r\\ncertainly not by themselves—good as they are, and admirable as the\\r\\nfirst is—enough to account for Vathek. Romance has passed there as\\r\\nwell as persiflage and something like coïonnerie; it is Romance that\\r\\nhas given us the baleful beauty of that Queen of Evil, Nouronnihar, and\\r\\nthe vision of the burning hearts that make their own wandering but\\r\\neternal Hell. The tendency of the novel had been on the whole, even in\\r\\nits best examples, to prose in feeling as well as in form. It was\\r\\nBeckford who availed himself of the poetry which is almost inseparable\\r\\nfrom Romance. But it was Horace Walpole who had opened the door to\\r\\nRomance herself.\\nStill, Vatheks are not to be had to order: and as Romance was wanted,\\r\\nto order and in bulk, during the late years of the eighteenth century,\\r\\nsome other kind had to be supplied. The chief accredited purveyors of it\\r\\nhave been already named and must now be dealt with, to be followed by\\r\\nthe list of secondary, never quite accomplished, exponents now of novel,\\r\\nnow of romance, now of the two mixed, who filled the closing years of\\r\\nthe eighteenth century.\\nIt is, however, unjust to put the author of The Mysteries of Udolpho\\r\\nand the author of The Monk on the same level. Mat Lewis was a clever\\r\\nboy with a lively fancy, a knack of catching and even of anticipating\\r\\npopular tendencies in literature, a rather vulgar taste by nature, and\\r\\nno faculty of self-criticism to correct it. The famous Monk (1795),\\r\\nwhich he published when he was twenty, is as preposterous as Otranto\\r\\nand adds to its preposterousness a haut goût of atrocity and indecency\\r\\nwhich Walpole was far too much of a gentleman, and even of a true man of\\r\\nletters, to attempt or to tolerate. Lewis\\'s other work in various forms\\r\\nis less offensive: but—except in respect of verse-rhythm which does not\\r\\nhere concern us—hardly any of it is literature. What does concern us is\\r\\nthat the time took it for literature, because it adopted the\\r\\nterror-style in fiction.\\nAnne Ward (she married a barrister named Radcliffe, of whom we do not\\r\\nhear much except that his engagements in journalism threw time on his\\r\\nwife\\'s hands for writing) appears to have started on her career of\\r\\nterror-novelist, in which she preceded Lewis, with two fixed resolves of\\r\\nprinciple very contrary to his practice. The first was to observe\\r\\nstrict \"propriety\" in her books—a point in which the novel had always\\r\\nbeen a little peccant. The second and more questionable, but also more\\r\\noriginal, was a curious determination to lavish the appearance of the\\r\\nsupernatural, in accordance with the Walpolian tradition and the German\\r\\nadoption of it, but never to allow anything really supernatural in\\r\\nultimate explanation or want of explanation. She applied these two\\r\\nprinciples to the working out, over and over again, of practically the\\r\\nsame story—the persecutions of a beautiful and virtuous heroine, and\\r\\nher final deliverance from them. Her first attempt, The Castles of\\r\\nAthlin and Dunbayne, appeared as early as 1789: and she left a\\r\\nposthumous romance, Gaston de Blondeville, which did not come out till\\r\\n1826, four years after her death. She also wrote some poems and a volume\\r\\nof Travels (1794) which is important for a reason to be noticed\\r\\npresently. But her fame rests upon four books, which she published in\\r\\nseven years, between her own twenty-sixth and thirty-third, A Sicilian\\r\\nRomance (1790), The Romance of the Forest (1791), the world-renowned\\r\\nMysteries of Udolpho in 1794-1795, and The Italian two years later.\\nThese stories owed their original attraction to the skill with which, by\\r\\nthe use of a Defoe-like minuteness of detail, added to a pictorial\\r\\nfaculty which Defoe had not, an atmosphere of terror is constantly\\r\\ndiffused and kept up. Very little that is terrible actually happens: but\\r\\nthe artist succeeds (so long as the trick has not become too familiar)\\r\\nin persuading you that something very terrible is going to happen, or\\r\\nhas just happened. And so the delight of something \"horrid,\" as the\\r\\nCatherines and Isabellas of the day put it, is given much more\\r\\nplentifully, and even much more excitingly, than it could be by a real\\r\\nhorror now and then, with intervals of miscellaneous business. In one\\r\\nsense, indeed, the process will not stand even the slightest critical\\r\\nexamination: for it is soon seen to consist of a succession of serious\\r\\nmystifications and non-comic much-ados-about-nothing. But these \"ados\"\\r\\nare most cunningly made (her last book, The Italian, is, perhaps, the\\r\\nbest place to look for them, if the reader is not taking up the whole\\r\\nsubject with a virtuous thoroughness), and Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s great praise\\r\\nis that she induced her original readers to suspend their critical\\r\\nfaculties sufficiently to enable them to take it all seriously. Scott,\\r\\nwho undoubtedly owed her something, assigned her positive genius: and\\r\\nmodern critics, while, perhaps, seldom experiencing much real\\r\\ndelectation from her work, have discovered in it not a few positive and\\r\\nmany more indirect and comparative merits. The influence on Scott is not\\r\\nthe least of these: but there is even a more unquestionable asset of the\\r\\nsame kind in the fact that the Byronic villain-hero, if not Byron\\r\\nhimself, is Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s work. Schedoni did much more than beget or\\r\\npattern Lara: he is Lara, to all intents and purposes, in \"first\\r\\nstate\" and before the final touch has been put by the greater master who\\r\\ntook the plate in hand.\\nBut there is more to be said for Mrs. Radcliffe than this. Her\\r\\n\"explained supernatural,\" tiresome as it may be to some of us nowadays,\\r\\nis really a marvel of patience and ingenuity: and this same quality\\r\\nextends to her plots generally. The historical side of her novels (which\\r\\nshe does to some extent attempt) is a failure, as everything of the kind\\r\\nwas before Scott: that we may leave till we come to Scott himself. But\\r\\none important engine of the novelist she set to work in a fashion which\\r\\nhad never been managed before, and that is elaborate description. She\\r\\nshows an early adaptation of that \"picturesque,\" of which we see the\\r\\nbeginnings in Gray, when she was in the nursery, which was being\\r\\ndirectly developed by Gilpin, but which, as we may see from her\\r\\nTravels, she had got not merely from books, but from her own\\r\\nobservation. She applies it both within and without: at one moment\\r\\ngiving pages on the scenery of the Apennines, at another paragraphs on\\r\\nthe furniture of her abbeys and castles. The pine forests and the\\r\\ncataracts; the skyline of Udolpho bathed in sunset glow, while a\\r\\n\"melancholy purple tint\" steals up the slopes to its foundations—are\\r\\nall in the day\\'s work now; but they were not so then, and it is fair to\\r\\nsay that Mrs. Radcliffe does them well. The \"high canopied tester of\\r\\ndark green damask\" and the \"counterpane of black velvet\" which\\r\\nillustrate the introduction of the famous chapter of the Black Pall in\\r\\nChateau le Blanc may be mere inventory goods now: but, once more, they\\r\\nwere not so then. And this faculty of description (which, as noted\\r\\nabove, could hardly have been, and pretty certainly was not, got from\\r\\nbooks, though it may have been, to some extent and quite legitimately,\\r\\ngot from pictures) was applied in many minor ways—touches of really or\\r\\nsupposedly horrible objects in the dark, faint suggestions of sound, or\\r\\nof appeals to the other senses—hints of all sorts, which were to become\\r\\ncommon tricks of the trade, but were then quite new.\\nAt any rate, by these and other means she attained that great result of\\r\\nthe novel which has been noted in Defoe, in Richardson, and in\\r\\nothers—the result of what the French vividly call enfisting the\\r\\nreader—getting hold of his attention, absorbing him in a pleasant\\r\\nfashion. The mechanism was often too mechanical: taken with the\\r\\nauthor\\'s steady and honest, but somewhat inartistic determination to\\r\\nexplain everything it sometimes produces effects positively ridiculous\\r\\nto us. With the proviso of valeat quantum, it is not quite unfair to\\r\\ndwell, as has often been dwelt, on the fact that the grand triumph of\\r\\nMrs. Radcliffe\\'s terrormongering—the famous incident of the Black\\r\\nVeil—is produced by a piece of wax-work. But the result resulted—the\\r\\neffect was produced: and it was left to those who were clever enough\\r\\nto improve upon the means. For the time these means were \"improved upon\"\\r\\nin another sense; we shall glance at some of the caricatures, intended\\r\\nand unintended, later. For the present we may turn to other varieties of\\r\\nthe curiously swarming novel-production of these two last decades of the\\r\\ncentury, and especially of the very last.\\nIf Scott had not established Richard Cumberland\\'s Henry (1795) in the\\r\\nfortress of the Ballantyne Novels, it would hardly be necessary to\\r\\nnotice \"Sir Fretful Plagiary\\'s\" contributions to the subject of our\\r\\nhistory. He preluded it with another, Arundel (1789), and followed it\\r\\nmuch later with a third, John de Lancaster: but there is no need to\\r\\nsay anything of these. Henry displays the odd hit-and-miss quality\\r\\nwhich seems to have attached itself to Cumberland everywhere, whether as\\r\\nnovelist, dramatist, essayist, diplomatist, poet, or anything else. It\\r\\nis, though by no means a mere \"plagiarism,\" an obvious and avowed\\r\\nimitation of Fielding, and the writer is so intent on his pastiche\\r\\nthat he seems quite oblivious himself, and appears to expect equal\\r\\noblivion on the part of his readers, of the fact that nearly two\\r\\ngenerations had passed. Henry is Joseph; Susan May is a much more\\r\\nelaborate and attractive Betty; the doctor\\'s wife a vulgarised and\\r\\nrepulsive Lady Booby; Ezekiel Daw, whom Scott admired, a dissenting\\r\\nAdams—the full force of the outrage of which variation Sir Walter\\r\\nperhaps did not feel. There are some good things in the story, but, as a\\r\\nwhole, it is chiefly valuable as an early example of that great danger\\r\\nof modern literature—the influence of the \"printed book\" itself: and in\\r\\na less degree of that forging ahead of the novel generally in public\\r\\nfavour which we are chronicling. If the kind had not been popular, and\\r\\nif Fielding had not been its great prophet, one may be pretty sure that\\r\\nHenry would never have existed. The causes are important: the effect\\r\\nnot quite so.\\nThere was, however, at this time a novel-school, and not such a very\\r\\nsmall one, which had more legitimate reasons for existence, inasmuch as\\r\\nit really served as mouthpiece to the thoughts and opinions of the time,\\r\\nwhether these thoughts and opinions were good or bad. This may be called\\r\\nthe \"revolutionary school,\" and its three most distinguished scholars\\r\\nwere Bage, Holcroft, and Godwin, with Mrs. Inchbald perhaps to be added.\\r\\nThe first began considerably before the outbreak of the actual French\\r\\nRevolution and shows the influence of its causes: the others were\\r\\ndirectly influenced by itself.\\nOne of the most remarkable of English novel-writers who are not absolute\\r\\nsuccesses, and one who, though less completely obscured by Fortune than\\r\\nsome, has never had quite his due, is Robert Bage. It was unfortunate\\r\\nfor him that he fell in with the crude generation contemporary in their\\r\\nmanhood with the French Revolution, and so manifested the crudity in\\r\\nfull. Bage, in fact, except for a certain strength of humour, is almost\\r\\nmore French than English. He has been put in the school of Richardson,\\r\\nbut it is certain that Richardson would have been shocked at the\\r\\nsupposed scholar: and it is not certain that Bage would or need have\\r\\nfelt complimented by the assignment of the master. He has the special\\r\\nlaxity of the time in point of \"morality,\" or at least of decency; its\\r\\naffectations of rather childish perfectibilism and anti-theism; and the\\r\\ntendency of at least a part of it to an odd Calibanic jesting. Bage is\\r\\ngood-tempered enough as it is: but he rather suggests possible\\r\\nCarrier-and-Fouché developments in a favourable and fostering\\r\\natmosphere. One does not quite know why Scott, who included in the\\r\\nBallantyne Novels three of Bage\\'s, Mount Henneth (1781), Barham\\r\\nDowns (1784), and James Wallace (1788), did not also include, if not\\r\\nThe Fair Syrian (1787), two others, Man as He is (1792) and the\\r\\nstill later Hermsprong, or Man as He is Not (1796). This last has\\r\\nsometimes been regarded as Bage\\'s masterpiece: but it does not seem so\\r\\nto the present writer. It begins by the sketch of an illegitimate child,\\r\\nwritten in Bage\\'s worst vein of hard rasping irony, entirely devoid of\\r\\nthe delicate spring and \"give\" which irony requires, and which\\r\\nconstitutes the triumph even of such things as A Tale of a Tub and\\r\\nJonathan Wild. The rather impossibly named Hermsprong himself is not\\r\\nreally so named at all, but is related (and in fact head-of-the-house)\\r\\nto the wicked or at least not good lord of the story. He is of the kind\\r\\nof Sir Charles Grandison, Rights-of-Mannified, which infests all these\\r\\nnovels and is a great bore—as, indeed, to me is the whole book. The\\r\\nearlier Man as He is is far better. The hero, Sir George Paradyne,\\r\\nthough of the same general class, is very much more tolerable and (being\\r\\nsometimes naughty) preferable to Grandison himself: while the heroine—a\\r\\ncertain Miss Colerain, who is a merchant\\'s daughter under a double cloud\\r\\nof her father\\'s misfortune and of calumny as regards herself—though not\\r\\nan absolute success, is worth a dozen Harriets, with thirteen\\r\\nCharlottes thrown in to make \"25 as 24\" in bookseller\\'s phrase. Bage\\'s\\r\\nextravagant or perhaps only too literal manners-painting (for it was an\\r\\nodd time) appears not infrequently, as in the anecdote of a justly\\r\\nenraged, though as a matter of fact mistaken, husband, who finds a young\\r\\ngentleman sitting on his wife\\'s lap, with her arms round him, while he\\r\\nis literally and en tout bien tout honneur painting her face—being a\\r\\ngreat artist in that way. Mount Henneth is perhaps the liveliest of\\r\\nall: though its liveliness is partly achieved by less merely extravagant\\r\\nunconventionalities than this. But as a matter of fact Bage never\\r\\nentirely \"comes off\": though there is cleverness enough in him to have\\r\\nmade a dozen popular and deservedly popular novelists at a better time\\r\\nfor the novel. For he was essentially a novelist of manners and\\r\\ncharacter at a transition time, when manners and character had come out\\r\\nof one stage and had not settled into another. Even Miss Edgeworth in\\r\\nBelinda shows the disadvantage of this: and she was a lady of genius,\\r\\nwhile Bage had only talent and was not quite a gentleman.\\nThomas Holcroft was not a gentleman at all, never pretended to the\\r\\ntitle, and would probably have been rather affronted if any one had\\r\\napplied it to him: for he was a violent Atheist and Jacobin, glorying in\\r\\nhis extraction from a shoemaker and an oysterseller, and in his\\r\\neducation as a stable boy. He was, however, a man of considerable\\r\\nintellectual power and of some literary gift, which chiefly showed\\r\\nitself in his dramas (the best known, The Road to Ruin), but is not\\r\\nquite absent from his novels Alwyn (1780), Anna St. Ives (1792), and\\r\\nHugh Trevor (1794-1797). The series runs in curious parallel to that\\r\\nof Bage\\'s work: for Alwyn, the liveliest and the earliest by far of\\r\\nthe three, is little more than a study partly after Fielding, but more\\r\\nafter Smollett, with his own experiences brought in. The other two are\\r\\npurpose-novels of anarchist perfectibilism, and Holcroft enjoys the\\r\\ntraditional credit of having directly inspired Godwin. Godwin himself\\r\\nacknowledged the obligation; indeed it is well known that—in pecuniary\\r\\nmatters more particularly—Godwin had no hesitation either in incurring\\r\\nor in acknowledging obligations, always provided that he was not\\r\\nexpected to discharge them. It is possible that Holcroft\\'s rough and\\r\\nready acceptance and exaggeration of the doctrines which Rousseau had\\r\\n(as seems most probable) developed from a paradox of Diderot\\'s, gave an\\r\\nimpetus to the rather sluggish but more systematic mind of Godwin. But\\r\\nit is certain that Political Justice, though it is not a novel at all,\\r\\nis a much more amusing book than Anna St. Ives, which is one. And\\r\\nthough Holcroft (especially if the presence of this quality in his\\r\\nAutobiography is not wholly due to Hazlitt—there is some chance that\\r\\nit is) possessed a liveliness in narrative to which Godwin could never\\r\\nattain, there is no doubt that this enigmatical and many-sided spunger,\\r\\nphilanderer, and corruptor of youth had a much higher general\\r\\nqualification for novel-writing than any one mentioned hitherto in this\\r\\nchapter, or perhaps than any to be mentioned, except the curiously\\r\\ncontrasted pair, of Irish birth, who are to come last in it.\\nI have sometimes thought that the greatest testimony to Godwin\\'s power\\r\\nin this respect is the idea (which even Hazlitt, though he did not share\\r\\nit, does not seem to have thought preposterous, and which seems to have\\r\\nbeen held by others who were not fools) that Godwin might be the author\\r\\nof Waverley. To us, looking back, the notion seems as absurd as that\\r\\nBacon could be the author of Shakespeare or Steele of the Tale of a\\r\\nTub: but if, instead of looking back, we throw ourselves back, the\\r\\nabsurdity does not quite persist as it does in the other two instances.\\r\\nThere are some who, of course, would say, \"Why take this fanciful test\\r\\nof Godwin\\'s ability when you have a real one in Caleb Williams?\" The\\r\\nreasons are double: for, historically, such an estimate by\\r\\ncontemporaries is of the very first value, and to the present writer\\r\\nCaleb Williams (1794) has never seemed a very interesting book. It is\\r\\nimpossible to sympathise with a hero who is actuated by the very lowest\\r\\nof human motives, sheer inquisitiveness: and my sense of natural\\r\\njustice (which is different from Godwin\\'s) demands not that he shall\\r\\nescape, but that he shall be broken on the wheel, or burnt at a slow\\r\\nfire, or made to read Political Justice after the novelty of its\\r\\ncolossal want of humour has palled on him. One could sympathise with\\r\\nFalkland, but is not allowed to do so: because he is not human, except\\r\\nin his crime. But, as has been said, to those whose sporting interests\\r\\nare excited by the pleasures and hazards of the chase, these things no\\r\\ndoubt do not occur. After all Caleb is, in a sense, the first\\r\\n\"detective novel\": and detective novels have always been popular, though\\r\\nthey bore some people to extinction. Far, however, be it from me to deny\\r\\nthat this popularity, especially when, as in the present case, it has\\r\\nbeen continued for four whole generations, is a real and a very\\r\\nconsiderable asset. Even if it were now to cease, it is actually funded\\r\\nand vested to Godwin\\'s credit in the grand livre of literary history:\\r\\nand it can never be written off. Perhaps Caleb is the one book of the\\r\\nlater English eighteenth century in novel for which there must always be\\r\\na public as soon as it is presented to that public. And when this is\\r\\nsaid and endorsed by those who do not personally much care for the book,\\r\\nit is at once a sufficient testimony to the position of the author, and\\r\\na vindication of the not absolutely imbecile position of those who\\r\\nthought that he might have written Waverley and its successors. The\\r\\nway in which Godwin in his later novels came down from the mountain-tops\\r\\nof theory and paradox just as he came down from those of Political\\r\\nJustice itself is interesting and amusing, but not for us. As novels\\r\\nthey are certainly inferior. The best parts of St. Leon (1799) and\\r\\nFleetwood (1805) are perhaps better than anything in Caleb:\\r\\nMandeville (1817) and Deloraine (1833) are senilia.15 The\\r\\ngraceful figure of the heroine Marguerite in St. Leon is said to be\\r\\nmodelled on Mary Wollstonecraft, and there are some fresh pictures of\\r\\nyouth and childhood in Fleetwood. But St. Leon, besides its\\r\\nhistorical shortcomings (which, once more, we may postpone), is full of\\r\\nfaults, from the badly managed supernatural to an only too natural\\r\\ndullness and languor of general story: nor has Fleetwood anything like\\r\\nthe absorbing power which Caleb Williams exercises, in its own way and\\r\\non its own people. Yet again we may perhaps say that the chief interest\\r\\nof Godwin, from our point of view, is his repeated and further weighted\\r\\ntestimony to the importance of the novel as an appeal to public\\r\\nattention. In this respect it was in fact displacing, not only the drama\\r\\non one side, but the sermon on the other. Not so very long before these\\r\\ntwo had almost engrossed the domain of popular literature, the graver\\r\\nand more precise folk habitually reading sermons as well as hearing\\r\\nthem, and the looser and lighter folk reading drama much oftener than\\r\\n(in then-existing circumstances) they had the opportunity of seeing it.\\r\\nWith the novel the \"address to the reader\" became direct and stood by\\r\\nitself. The novelist could emulate Burke with his right barrel and\\r\\nLydia Languish with his left. He certainly did not always endeavour to\\r\\nprofit as well as to delight: but the double power was, from this time\\r\\nforward, shared by him with his brother in the higher and older\\r\\nDichtung.\\nNext to Godwin may be placed a lady who was much adored by that curious\\r\\nprofessor of philandering, political injustice, psychology, and the\\r\\nuse of the spunge, but who wisely put him off. Mrs. Inchbald\\'s\\r\\n(1753-1821) command of a certain kind of dramatic or at least theatrical\\r\\nsituation, and her propensity to Richardsonian \"human-heart\"-mongering,\\r\\nhave from time to time secured a certain number of admirers for A\\r\\nSimple Story (1791) and Nature and Art (1796). Some, availing\\r\\nthemselves of the confusion between \"style\" and \"handling\" which has\\r\\nrecently become fashionable, have even credited her with style itself.\\r\\nOf this she has nothing—unless the most conventional of\\r\\neighteenth-century phraseology, dashed with a kind of marivaudage\\r\\nwhich may perhaps seem original to those who do not know Marivaux\\'s\\r\\nFrench followers, shall deserve the name. She is indeed very much of an\\r\\nEnglish Madame Riccoboni. But her situations—such as the meeting in A\\r\\nSimple Story of a father with the daughter whom, though not exactly\\r\\ncasting her off, he has persistently refused to see, in revenge for her\\r\\nmother\\'s unfaithfulness, and the still more famous scene in Nature and\\r\\nArt where a judge passes the death-sentence on a woman whom he has\\r\\nbetrayed—have, as has been allowed, the dramatic or melodramatic\\r\\nquality which attracts people in \"decadent\" periods. There seems,\\r\\nindeed, to have been a certain decadent charm about Mrs. Inchbald\\r\\nherself—with her beauty, her stage skill, her strict virtue combined\\r\\nwith any amount of \"sensibility,\" her affectation of nature, and her\\r\\nbenevolence not in the least sham but distinctly posing. And something\\r\\nof this rococo relish may no doubt, with a little good will and\\r\\nsympathy, be detected in her books. But of the genuine life and the\\r\\nnatural language which occasionally inspirit the much more unequal and\\r\\nmore generally commonplace work of Miss Burney, she has practically\\r\\nnothing. And she thus falls out of the main line of development, merely\\r\\nexemplifying the revolutionary and sentimental episode.\\nWe must now, for some pages, illustrate the course of the novel by minor\\r\\nexamples: and we may begin with a brief notice of two writers, one of\\r\\nwhom might have been taken before Miss Burney and the other just after\\r\\nher chronologically: but who, in the order of thought and method, will\\r\\ncome better here. Both were natives of Scotland and both illustrate\\r\\ndifferent ways of the novel. Henry Mackenzie, an Edinburgh advocate, in\\r\\nthree books—the names of which at least are famous, while his friend\\r\\nSir Walter has preserved the books themselves in the collection so often\\r\\nmentioned—produced, in his own youth and in rapid succession, The Man\\r\\nof Feeling (1771), The Man of the World (1773), and Julia de\\r\\nRoubigné (1777). John Moore, a Glasgow physician, wrote, when he was\\r\\nnearly sixty, the novel of Zeluco (1786) and followed it up with\\r\\nEdward ten years afterwards and Mordaunt (1800). Mackenzie did good\\r\\nwork later in the periodical essay: but his fiction is chiefly the\\r\\n\"sensibility\"-novel of the French and of Sterne, reduced to the\\r\\nabsolutely absurd. From his essay-work, and from Scott\\'s and other\\r\\naccounts of him, he must have possessed humour of a kind: but the\\r\\nextremely limited character of its nature and operation may be\\r\\nexemplified by his representation of a whole press-gang as bursting into\\r\\ntears at the pathetic action and words of an old man who offers himself\\r\\nas substitute for his son. This is one of the not rare, but certainly\\r\\none of the most consummate, instances of fashion caricaturing itself in\\r\\ntotal unconsciousness. But it was the fashion: and Mackenzie, though\\r\\nperhaps he helped to bring it to an end, no doubt caused the shedding,\\r\\nby \"the fair\" of the time, of an ocean of tears as great as the ocean of\\r\\nport wine which was contemporaneously absorbed by \"the brave.\"\\nMoore saw a good deal of continental society—he is indeed one of the\\r\\nfirst-hand witnesses for the events of the French Revolution—and he had\\r\\na more considerable influence on the novel than has always been allowed\\r\\nhim. Zeluco chiefly survives because of the exquisitely ludicrous and\\r\\nhuman trait of the English sailor who, discussing the French army,\\r\\npronounces white uniforms \"absurd\" and blue \"only fit for the artillery\\r\\nand the blue horse.\" But it is not quite certain that its villain-hero\\r\\nhad not something, and perhaps a good deal, to do with those of Mrs.\\r\\nRadcliffe who were soon to follow, and, through these, with Byron who\\r\\nwas not to be very long after. The later books are of much less\\r\\nimportance, if only because they follow the outburst of fiction which\\r\\nthe French Revolution itself ushered. But Moore, who was intimately\\r\\nconnected with Smollett, carried on the practice of making national or\\r\\nsub-national characteristics important elements of novel interest: and\\r\\nis thus noteworthy in more ways than one.\\nHe is a late instance—he was born in 1729 and so was only a few years\\r\\nyounger than Smollett himself—of the writers who had, for all but half\\r\\na century after Richardson\\'s appearance, accumulated patterns and\\r\\nexamples of the novel in all sorts of forms, hardly one of which lacked\\r\\nnumerous and almost innumerable imitators and followers. By these later\\r\\nyears of the century the famous \"Minerva Press\" and many others issued\\r\\ndeluges of novel-work which were eagerly absorbed by readers.\\r\\n\"Absorbed\" in more senses than one: for the institution of circulating\\r\\nlibraries, while it facilitated reading, naturally tended towards the\\r\\ndestruction of the actual volumes read. Novels were rarely produced in a\\r\\nvery careful or sumptuous fashion, and good copies of those that were in\\r\\nany way popular are now rather hard to obtain: while even in the British\\r\\nMuseum it will frequently be found that only the later editions are\\r\\nrepresented. We shall finish this chapter with some instances, taken not\\r\\nquite at random, of the work of the last decades of the eighteenth and\\r\\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, winding up with more general\\r\\nnotice of two remarkable writers who represent—though at least one of\\r\\nthem lived far later—the period before Scott, and who also, as it\\r\\nhappens, represent the contrast of novel and romance in a fashion\\r\\nunusually striking. The description, as some readers will have\\r\\nanticipated, refers to Miss Edgeworth and to Maturin. But the smaller\\r\\nfry must be taken first.\\nIt is not uninteresting to compare two such books as Mrs. Bennett\\'s\\r\\nAnna and Mrs. Opie\\'s Adeline Mowbray. Published at twenty years\\'\\r\\ndistance (1785 and 1804) they show the rapid growth of the novel, even\\r\\nduring a time when nothing of the first class appeared. Anna, or the\\r\\nMemoirs of a Welsh Heiress, interspersed with Anecdotes of a Nabob, is\\r\\na kind of bad imitation of Miss Burney, with a catchpenny\\r\\n\"interspersion\" to suit the day. Adeline Mowbray, written with more\\r\\ntalent, chimes in by infusing one of the tones of its day—Godwinian\\r\\ntheories of life. The space between was the palmy time of that now\\r\\nalmost legendary \"Minerva Press\" which, as has been said, flooded the\\r\\never-absorbent market with stuff of which The Libertine, masterpiece\\r\\nof Mrs. Byrne, alias Charlotte Dacre, alias \"Rosa Matilda,\" is\\r\\nperhaps best worth singling out from its companions, Hours of Solitude,\\r\\nThe Nun of St. Omers, Zofloya, etc., because it specially shocked the\\r\\ncensor of the style who will be mentioned presently. It is pure (or\\r\\nnot-pure) rubbish. Angelo (the libertine) seduces the angelic Gabrielle\\r\\nde Montmorency, who follows him to Italy in male attire, saves him from\\r\\nthe wicked courtesan Oriana and her bravo Fiorenza (sic), is married\\r\\nby him, but made miserable, and dies. He continues his misbehaviour to\\r\\ntheir children, and finally blows his brains out. \"Bah! it is bosh!\" as\\r\\nthe Master observes of something else.\\nIt may seem iniquitous to say that some tolerably good novel-writers\\r\\nmust be more summarily treated than some bad ones here: but there is\\r\\nreason for it. Such, for instance, as Charlotte Smith and the Miss Lees\\r\\nare miles above such others as the just-mentioned polyonymous \"Rosa,\" as\\r\\nSarah Wilkinson, or as Henrietta Mosse-Rouvière. The first three would\\r\\nmake a very good group for a twenty-page causerie. Charlotte Smith, who\\r\\nwas tolerably expert in verse as well as prose; who anticipated, and\\r\\nperhaps taught, Scott in the double use of the name \"Waverley\"; and\\r\\nwhose Old Manor House (1793) is a solid but not heavy work of its\\r\\nkind—is something of a person in herself, but less of a figure in\\r\\nhistory, because she neither innovates nor does old things consummately.\\r\\nHarriet and Sophia Lee claimed innovation for the latter\\'s Recess\\r\\n(1783-1786), as Miss Porter did for Thaddeus of Warsaw, but the claim\\r\\ncan be even less allowed. There is nothing of real historical spirit,\\r\\nand very little goodness of any kind, in The Recess. The Canterbury\\r\\nTales (1797-1805) (so named merely because they are supposed to be told\\r\\nby different persons) were praised by Byron, as he praised the Percy\\r\\nAnecdotes and other things—either irresponsibly or impishly. They are\\r\\nnot exactly bad: but also as far as possible from consummateness.\\nOn the other hand, The Convent of Grey Penitents, one of the crops\\r\\nwhich rewarded Miss Wilkinson for tilling the lands of her imagination\\r\\nwith the spade of her style, is very nearly consummate—in badness. It\\r\\nis a fair example of the worst imitations of Mrs. Radcliffe and Mat\\r\\nLewis conjointly, though without the latter\\'s looseness. The Marquis di\\r\\nZoretti was an Italian nobleman—\"one of those characters in whose bosom\\r\\nresides an unquenchable thirst of avarice\" [\"thirst of avarice\" is\\r\\ngood!], etc. He marries, however, a lovely signora of the odd name of\\r\\nRosalthe, without a fortune, \"which circumstance was overlooked by his\\r\\nlordship\" for a very short time only. He plots to be free of her: she\\r\\ngoes to England and dies there to the genteelest of slow music. Their\\r\\nson Horatio falls in love with a certain Julietta, who is immured by\\r\\nwicked arts in the \"Convent of Grey Penitents,\" tormented by the head,\\r\\nGradisca, but rescued, and so forth. The book, if harmless, is about as\\r\\nworthless as a book can be: but it represents, very fairly, the ruck, if\\r\\nnot indeed even the main body, of the enormous horde of romances which\\r\\nissued from the press towards the end of the eighteenth century and the\\r\\nbeginning of the nineteenth, and which, in their different action on\\r\\npersons of genius, gave us Zastrozzi on the one side and Northanger\\r\\nAbbey on the other.\\nAs for Miss Henrietta Mosse, otherwise Rouvière, she represents the\\r\\nother school of abortive historical novel. A Peep at Our Ancestors\\r\\n(1807) is fairly worthy of its ridiculous name. It is preceded by\\r\\nexpressions of thanks to the authorities of \"the British Museum and the\\r\\nHeralds\\' Office\" for the \"access to records\" vouchsafed to its author.\\r\\nAs the date of the story is 1146 (it was long before Mr. Freeman wrote)\\r\\naccess to records would certainly not have been superfluous. The actual\\r\\nresults of it are blocks of spiritless and commonplace historic\\r\\nnarrative—it is nearly all narrative, not action—diversified by\\r\\nutterances like this of Malcolm III. of Scotland, \"O my Edward! the deed\\r\\nwhich struck my son\\'s life has centred [sic] thy noble youthful bosom\\r\\nalso,\" or this of the heroine (such as there is), \"the gentle elegant\\r\\nAdelaise,\" \"And do I not already receive my education of thee, mamma?\"\\r\\nIt is really a pity that the creator of this remarkable peep-show did\\r\\nnot give references to her \"records,\" so that one might look up this\\r\\n\"elegant\" young creature of the twelfth century who talked about\\r\\n\"education\" and said \"mamma!\" But this absolute failure in\\r\\nverisimilitude is practically universal before Scott.\\nThe works of the very beautifully named Regina Maria Roche should\\r\\nprobably be read, as they were for generations, in late childhood or\\r\\nearly youth. Even then an intelligent boy or girl would perceive some of\\r\\nthe absurdity, but might catch a charm that escapes the less receptive\\r\\noldster. They were, beyond all question, immensely popular, and\\r\\ncontinued to be so for a long time: in fact it is almost sufficient\\r\\nevidence that there is, if I mistake not, in the British Museum no\\r\\nedition earlier than the tenth of the most famous of them, The Children\\r\\nof the Abbey (1798). This far-renowned work opens with the exclamation\\r\\nof the heroine Amanda, \"Hail, sweet sojourn of my infancy!\" and we are\\r\\nshortly afterwards informed that in the garden \"the part appropriated to\\r\\nvegetables was divided from the part sacred to Flora.\" Otherwise, the\\r\\nsubstance of the thing is a curious sort of watered-down Richardson,\\r\\npassed through successive filtering beds of Mackenzie, and even of Mrs.\\r\\nRadcliffe. It is difficult for even the most critical taste to find much\\r\\nsavour or stimulus in the resulting liquid. But, like almost everybody\\r\\nmentioned here, Regina is a document of the demands of readers and the\\r\\nfaculty of writers: and so she \"standeth,\" if not exactly \"crowned,\" yet\\r\\nticketed.\\nWork—somewhat later—of some interest, but not of first-class quality,\\r\\nis to be found in the Discipline (1811) and Self-Control (1814) of\\r\\nMary Brunton. A Balfour of Orkney on the father\\'s side and a Ligonier on\\r\\nthe mother\\'s, the authoress had access to the best English as well as\\r\\nScottish society, and seems to have had more than a chance of taking a\\r\\nplace in the former: but preferred to marry a minister-professor and\\r\\nsettled down to country manse life. She died in middle age and her\\r\\nhusband wrote a memoir of her. Discipline seems to represent a sort of\\r\\nfancy combination of the life she might have led and the life she did\\r\\nlead. Ellen Percy, the heroine, starts in the highest circles; forgets\\r\\nherself so far as to \"waltze\" with a noble ne\\'er-do-weel, thereby\\r\\nearning the \"stern disapprobation\" of a respectable lover; comes down in\\r\\nthe world; has Highland experiences which, at the book\\'s early date, are\\r\\nnoteworthy; marries (like her creatress) a minister; but \"retains a\\r\\nlittle of her coquettish sauciness.\" \"Bless her, poor little dear!\" one\\r\\ncan imagine Thackeray exclaiming in his later and mellowed days. Mrs.\\r\\nBrunton\\'s letters breathe a lady-like and not unamiable propriety, and\\r\\nshe is altogether a sort of milder, though actually earlier, Miss\\r\\nFerrier.\\nIreland vindicated its claim to comparative liveliness in the work of a\\r\\nbetter known contemporary and survivor. Lady Morgan\\'s (Miss Sydney\\r\\nOwenson\\'s) Wild Irish Girl (1806) is one of the books whose titles\\r\\nhave prolonged for them a kind of shadowy existence. It is written in\\r\\nletters: and the most interesting thing about it for some readers now is\\r\\nthat the heroine supplied Thackeray with the name Glorvina, which, it\\r\\nseems, means in Irish \"sweet voice,\" if Lady Morgan is to be trusted in\\r\\nrebus Celticis. It is to be hoped she is: for the novel is a sort of\\r\\nmacédoine of Irish history, folk-lore, scenery, and what not, done up\\r\\nin a syrup of love-making quant. suff. Its author wrote many more\\r\\nnovels and became a butt for both good- and ill-natured satire with the\\r\\ncomic writers of the twenties, thirties, and forties. The title was\\r\\nactually borrowed by Maturin in The Wild Irish \"Boy,\" and it is fair\\r\\nto say that the book preceded Scott\\'s, though not Miss Edgeworth\\'s,\\r\\nexperiments in the line of the \"national\" novel. The earlier Reviewers\\r\\nwere discreditably savage on women-writers, and Lady Morgan had her\\r\\nshare of their truculence. She did not wholly deserve it: but it must be\\r\\nsaid that nothing she wrote can really be ranked as literature, save on\\r\\nthe most indiscriminate and uncritical estimate. It is, however,\\r\\ndifficult to see much harm in her.\\nIda of Athens, for instance, which shocked contemporaries, and which,\\r\\nby the way, has the very large first title of Woman, could only bring\\r\\na blush to cheeks very tickle of that sere: a yawn might come much more\\r\\neasily. The most shocking thing that the heroine, who is \"an attempt to\\r\\ndelineate woman in her natural state,\" does (and that not of malice) is\\r\\nto receive her lover in a natural bathroom. But her adventures are told\\r\\nin a style which is the oddest compound of Romantesque and Johnsonese.\\r\\n(\"The hour was ardent. The bath was cool. He calculated upon the\\r\\nprobable necessity of its enjoyment.\") The spirit is the silliest and\\r\\nmost ignorant Philhellenism—all the beauty, virtue, wisdom, of the\\r\\nancient Greeks being supposed to be inherited by their mongrel\\r\\nsuccessors of the early nineteenth century. An English and a Turkish\\r\\nlover dispute Ida\\'s affection or possession. There are the elaborate\\r\\npseudo-erudite notes which one has learnt to associate chiefly with\\r\\nMoore. The authoress boasts in her preface that she \"has already written\\r\\nalmost as many volumes as she has years,\" and that she has hardly ever\\r\\ncorrected her proofs. Perhaps this silliness will make some think her\\r\\nnot more an example of the savagery of contemporary criticism than a\\r\\njustification thereof.\\nIt was in fact not only brutal man who objected to the preposterous\\r\\nexcesses of pseudo-romance: and serious or jocular parables were taken\\r\\nup against it, if not before Northanger Abbey was written, long before\\r\\nit was published. In 1810 a certain \"G.\" or \"S.G.,\" whose full name was\\r\\nSarah Green, wrote, besides some actual history and an attempt at the\\r\\nhistorical novel, a very curious and rather hybrid book entitled\\r\\nRomance Readers and Romance Writers. Its preface is an instance of\\r\\n\"Women, beware Women,\" for though it stigmatises male creatures, such as\\r\\na certain Curteis and a certain Pickersgill, it treats Lady Morgan (then\\r\\nonly Sydney Owenson) and \"Rosa Matilda\" even more roughly and asks (as\\r\\nhas been asked about a hundred years later and was asked about a hundred\\r\\nyears before), \"Is it not amazing that the [two] most licentious writers\\r\\nof romance are women?\" And it starts with a burlesque account of a\\r\\ncertain Margaret Marsham who exclaims, \"What then? to add to my earthly\\r\\nmiseries am I to be called Peggy? My name is Margaritta!\" \"I am sure\\r\\nthat if I am called Peggy again I shall go into a fit.\" But this promise\\r\\nof something to complete the trio with Northanger Abbey and The\\r\\nHeroine (to be presently mentioned) is not maintained. Not only does\\r\\nthe writer force the note of parody too much by making \"Margaritta\" say\\r\\nto herself, \"Poor persecuted dove that I am,\" and adore a labourer\\'s\\r\\nshirt on a hedge, but she commits the far more fatal fault of exchanging\\r\\nher jest for earnest. Margaritta—following her romance-models—falls a\\r\\nvictim to an unprincipled great lady and the usual wicked baronet—at\\r\\nwhose head, one is bound to say, she flings herself with such violence\\r\\nas no baronet could possibly resist. Her sister Mary, innocent of\\r\\nromance-reading and all other faults, is, though not as guilty, as\\r\\nunlucky almost as Margaret: and by far the greater part of the book is\\r\\nan unreal presentment, in nearly the worst manner of the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury itself, of virtuous curates, unvirtuous \"tonish\" rectors, who\\r\\ncalmly propose to seduce their curates\\' daughters (an offence which, for\\r\\nobvious reasons, must, in the worst times, have been unusual), libertine\\r\\nladies, and reckless \"fashionables\" of all kinds. The preface and the\\r\\nopening create expectations, not merely of amusement but of power, which\\r\\nare by no means fulfilled. It is \"S.G.\" who asserts that Ida of Athens\\r\\n\"has brought a blush to the cheek of many,\" and one can only repeat the\\r\\nsuggested substitution.\\nThe only faults that can be found with The Heroine or The Adventures\\r\\nof Cherubina, by Eaton Stannard Barrett, which appeared in the same\\r\\nyear, with no very different object and subject, though written in\\r\\nlighter vein, are one that it could not help and another that it could.\\r\\nUnjustly, but unavoidably, the first is the worst. That it is a\\r\\nburlesque rather overdone—a burlesque burlesqué—not in the manner of\\r\\nThackeray, but in that of some older and some more recent writers—is\\r\\nunfortunate, but not fatal. One can forgive—one can even enjoy—the\\r\\nghost who not only sneezes but says, \"D—n, all is blown!\" When the\\r\\nheroine is actually locked up with a man in a chest one is more\\r\\ndoubtful: recovering when the Marquis de Furioso, \"bowing gracefully to\\r\\nthe bride,\" stabs himself to the heart, which is almost \"the real\\r\\nMackay\" as they say in the North. The slight awkwardness of snow falling\\r\\nthe day after the characters have been eating strawberries does not\\r\\namuse us much, because this is a comparatively ordinary event of the\\r\\nearly twentieth century, whatever it might be of the early nineteenth.\\r\\nBut what is fatal, though the author could not help it, is that the\\r\\ninfinitely lighter, more artistic, and more lethal dart of Northanger\\r\\nAbbey had been launched by the pen, if not the press, more than a dozen\\r\\nyears before.\\nThere are few more curious and interesting personages in the history of\\r\\nthe English Novel than Maria Edgeworth. The variety of her\\r\\naccomplishment in the kind was extraordinary: and in more than one of\\r\\nits species she went very near perfection. One is never quite certain\\r\\nwhether the perpetual meddling of her rather celebrated father\\r\\nRichard—one of the capital examples of the unpractical pragmatists and\\r\\nclever-silly crotcheteers who produced and were produced by the\\r\\nRevolutionary period—did her more harm than good. It certainly loaded\\r\\nher work with superfluous and (to us) disgusting didacticism: but it\\r\\nmight be contended that, without its stimulus, she would have done much\\r\\nless, perhaps nothing. As it was, she lived for more than eighty years\\r\\n(till all but the middle of the nineteenth century) and wrote for more\\r\\nthan sixty. Her work is thus very bulky: but it may be considered, for\\r\\nour present purpose, in three groups—her short stories written mainly\\r\\nbut not wholly for children; her regular novels; and her Irish studies.\\r\\nOf these the middle division has been, and no doubt has deserved to be,\\r\\nthe least popular: but its principal example, Belinda (1801)\\r\\n(Patronage, a longer and later book, and others are inferior), is\\r\\nconsiderably better than is usually admitted and, by its early date,\\r\\ndeserves special notice here. It preceded Miss Austen\\'s work in\\r\\npublication, and is specially cited by her as a capital example of novel\\r\\nin connection with the work of Miss Burney: and it is evidently founded\\r\\non study of the latter, of which, indeed, it is the first really worthy\\r\\ncontinuation. Maria has nothing so good as Fanny\\'s Smiths and\\r\\nBranghtons: but the whole book is far superior to Evelina. The\\r\\nextravagance of the fin-de-siècle society which it represents has\\r\\nprobably disguised from not a few readers who do not know the facts, the\\r\\nother fact that it is a real attempt at realist observation of manners:\\r\\nand it has the narrative merit which was Miss Edgeworth\\'s gift of\\r\\nnature. But the hero is patchy and improbable: the heroine, a good and\\r\\nquite possible girl, is not sufficiently \"reliefed out\"; and the most\\r\\nimportant figures of the book, Lord and Lady Delacour, almost great\\r\\nsuccesses, are not helped by the peculiar academic-didactic moralising\\r\\nwhich she had caught from Marmontel.\\nThe following of that ingenious and now too much under-valued writer\\r\\nstood her in better stead in the Moral Tales (1801) (which she\\r\\ndeliberately called after his16), the Popular Tales of the same\\r\\nkind, and (though Marmontel did not intentionally write for children)\\r\\nthe delightful Parent\\'s Assistant (1801) and Frank. In the two\\r\\nfirst-named divisions, the narrative faculty just mentioned appears\\r\\nadmirably, together with another and still greater gift, that of\\r\\ncharacter-painting, and even a grasp of literary and social satire,\\r\\nwhich might not be anticipated from some of her other books. The French\\r\\ngoverness (Mlle. Panache) and the satire on romantic young-ladyism\\r\\n(Angelina) are excellent examples of this. As for the pure child\\'s\\r\\nstories, generation after generation of competent criticism, childish\\r\\nand adult, has voted them by acclamation into almost the highest place\\r\\npossible: and the gain-sayers have for the most part been idle\\r\\nparadoxers, ill-conditioned snarlers at things clean and sweet, or fools\\r\\npure and simple.\\nThe \"Irish brigade\" of the work—Castle Rackrent (1800), Ormond, and\\r\\nThe Absentee, with the non-narrative but closely-connected Essay on\\r\\nIrish Bulls—have perhaps commanded the most unchequered applause. They\\r\\nare not quite free from the sentimentality and the didacticism which\\r\\nwere both rampant in the novel of Miss Edgeworth\\'s earlier time: but\\r\\nthese are atoned for by a quite new use of the \"national\" element. Even\\r\\nSmollett and, following Smollett, Moore had chiefly availed themselves\\r\\nof this for its farcical or semi-farcical opportunities. Miss Edgeworth\\r\\ndid not neglect these, but she did not confine herself to them: and such\\r\\ncharacters as Corny the \"King of the Black Isles\" in Ormond actually\\r\\nadd a new province and a new pleasure to fiction.\\nHer importance is thus very great: and it only wanted the proverbial or\\r\\nanecdotic \"That!\" to make it much greater. \"That!\" as it generally is,\\r\\nwas in her case the last fusing touch of genius to accomplish the\\r\\ngrand oeuvre—the perfect projection. She had humour, pathos,\\r\\nknowledge of the world, power of drawing it, acquaintance with\\r\\nliterature, shrewd common sense, an excellent style when she was allowed\\r\\nto write in her own way, the feelings of a lady who was also a good\\r\\nwoman. King Charles is made to say in Woodstock that \"half the things\\r\\nin the world remind him of the Tales of Mother Goose.\" It is\\r\\nastonishing, in the real complimentary sense, how many things remind one\\r\\nof situations, passages, phrases, in Miss Edgeworth\\'s works of all the\\r\\nkinds from Castle Rackrent to Frank. She also had a great and an\\r\\nacknowledged influence on Scott, a considerable and a certainly not\\r\\ndisavowed influence on Miss Austen. She is good reading always, however\\r\\nmuch we may sometimes pish and pshaw at the untimely poppings-in of the\\r\\nplatitudes and crotchets (for he was that most abominable of things, a\\r\\nplatitudinous crotcheteer) of Richard her father. She was a girl of\\r\\nfourteen when the beginnings of the domestic novel were laid in\\r\\nEvelina, and she lived to see it triumph in Vanity Fair. But her own\\r\\nwork, save in some of her short stories, which are pretty perfect,\\r\\nrepresents the imperfect stage of the development—the stage when the\\r\\nnovel is trying for the right methods and struggling to get into the\\r\\nright ways, but has not wholly mastered the one or reached the others.\\nThere are those who would assign what they might call \"higher genius,\"\\r\\nor \"rarer gift,\" or something similar, to her countryman Charles Robert\\r\\nMaturin. The present writer is not very fond of these measurings\\r\\ntogether of things incommensurable—these attempts to rank the \"light\\r\\nwhite sea-mew\" as superior or inferior to the \"sleek black pantheress.\"\\r\\nIt is enough to say that while Miss Edgeworth very deliberately adopted\\r\\nthe novel, and even, as we have seen, slightly satirised at least\\r\\npseudo-romance, Maturin was romantic or nothing. His life was hardly\\r\\nhalf hers in length, and his temperament appears to have been as\\r\\ndiscontented as hers was sunny: but he had his successes in drama as\\r\\nwell as in novel, and one of his attempts in the latter kind had a\\r\\nwide-ranging influence abroad as well as at home, has been recently\\r\\nprinted both in whole and in part, and undoubtedly ranks among the\\r\\nnovels which any tolerably well instructed person would enumerate if he\\r\\nwere asked to give a pretty full list of celebrated (and deservedly\\r\\ncelebrated) books of the kind in English. The others fall quite out of\\r\\ncomparison. The Fatal Revenge or the Family of Montorio (1807) is a\\r\\ntry for the \"furthest\" in the Radcliffe-Lewis direction, discarding\\r\\nindeed the crudity of The Monk, but altogether neglecting the\\r\\nrestraint of Udolpho and its companions in the use of the\\r\\nsupernatural. The Wild Irish Boy (1808), The Milesian Chief (1812),\\r\\nWomen (1818), and The Albigenses (1824) are negligible, the last,\\r\\nperhaps, rather less so than the others. But Melmoth the Wanderer\\r\\n(1820) is in quite a different case. It has faults in plenty—especially\\r\\na narrative method of such involution that, as it has been said, \"a\\r\\nconsiderable part of the book consists of a story told to a certain\\r\\nperson, who is a character in a longer story, found in a manuscript\\r\\nwhich is delivered to a third person, who narrates the greater part of\\r\\nthe novel to a fourth person, who is the namesake and descendant of the\\r\\ntitle-hero.\" Stripped of these tiresome lendings (which, as has been\\r\\nfrequently pointed out, were a mania with the eighteenth century and\\r\\nnaturally grew to such intricacy as this), the central story, though not\\r\\nexactly new, is impressive: and it is told and worked out in manner more\\r\\nimpressive, because practically novel, save for, perhaps, a little\\r\\nsuggestion from Vathek. Melmoth has bartered his soul with the devil\\r\\nfor something like immortality and other privileges, including the\\r\\nunusual one of escaping doom if he can get some one to take the bargain\\r\\noff his hands. This leads up to numerous episodes or chapters in which\\r\\nMelmoth endeavours to obtain substitutes: and in one of these the love\\r\\ninterest of the book—the, of course, fatal love of Melmoth himself for\\r\\na Spanish-Indian girl Immalee or Isidora—is related with some real\\r\\npathos and passion, though with a good deal of mere sentiment and\\r\\ntwaddle. Maturin is stronger in his terror-scenes, and affected his own\\r\\ngeneration very powerfully: his influence being so great in France that\\r\\nBalzac attempted a variation and continuation, and that there are\\r\\nconstant references to the book in the early French Romantics. In fact\\r\\nfor this kind of \"sensation\" Maturin is, putting Vathek aside, quite\\r\\nthe chief of the whole school. But it is doubtful whether he had many\\r\\nother gifts as a novelist, and this particular one is one that cannot be\\r\\nexercised very frequently, and is very difficult to exercise at all\\r\\nwithout errors and extravagances.\\nThe child-literature of this school and period was very large, and, had\\r\\nwe space, would be worth dealing with at length—as in the instances of\\r\\nthe famous Sandford and Merton (1783-1789) by Thomas Day, Richard\\r\\nEdgeworth\\'s friend, of Mrs. Trimmer\\'s Story of the Robins, and others.\\r\\nIt led up to the definitely religious school of children\\'s books, first\\r\\nevangelical, then tractarian, with which we shall deal later: but was\\r\\nitself as a rule utilitarian—or sentimental—moral rather than directly\\r\\nreligious. It is, however, like other things—indeed almost all\\r\\nthings—in this chapter—a document of the fashion in which the novel\\r\\nwas \"filling all numbers\" and being used for all purposes. It was, of\\r\\ncourse, in this case, nearest to the world-old \"fable\"—especially to\\r\\nthe moral apologues of which the mediæval sermon-writers and others had\\r\\nbeen so fond. But its popularity, especially when taken in connection\\r\\nwith the still surviving distrust of fiction, is valuable. It involves\\r\\nnot merely the principle that \"the devil shall not have all the best\\r\\ntunes,\" but the admission that this tune is good.\\nThis point, and that other also frequently mentioned and closely\\r\\nconnected with it, that the novel at this time overflows into almost\\r\\nevery conceivable department of subject and object, are the main facts\\r\\nof a general historical kind, which should be in the reader\\'s mind as\\r\\nthe upshot of this chapter. But there is a third, almost as important as\\r\\neither, and that is the almost universal coming short of complete\\r\\nsuccess—the lack of consummateness, the sense that if the Novel Israel\\r\\nis not exactly still in the wilderness, it has not yet crossed the\\r\\nJordan. Even if we take in the last chapter, and its comparative giants,\\r\\nwith the present and its heroes, ordinary folk, and pygmies, we shall\\r\\nscarcely find more than one great master, Fielding, and one little\\r\\nmasterpiece, Vathek, deserving the adjective \"consummate.\" No doubt\\r\\nthe obvious explanation—that the hour was not because the man had not\\r\\ncome except in this single case—is a good one: but it need not be left\\r\\nin the bare isolation of its fatalism. There are at least several\\r\\nsubsidiary considerations which it is well to advance. The transition\\r\\nstate of manners and language cannot be too often insisted upon: for\\r\\nthis affected the process at both ends, giving the artist in fictitious\\r\\nlife an uncertain model to copy and unstable materials to work in. The\\r\\ndeficiency of classical patterns—at a time which still firmly believed,\\r\\nfor the most part, that all good work in literature had been so done by\\r\\nthe ancients that it could at best be emulated—should count for\\r\\nsomething: the scanty respect in which the kind was held for something\\r\\nmore. As to one of the most important species, frequent allusions have\\r\\nbeen made, and in the next chapter full treatment will be given, to the\\r\\ncauses which made the historical novel impossible until very late in\\r\\nthe century, and decidedly unlikely to be good even then. Perhaps,\\r\\nwithout attempting further detail, we may conclude by saying that the\\r\\nproductions of this time present, and present inevitably, the nonage and\\r\\nnovitiate of a branch of art which hardly possessed any genuine\\r\\nrepresentatives when the century was born and which numbered them, bad\\r\\nand good, by thousands and almost tens of thousands at its death. In the\\r\\ninterval there had been continuous and progressive exercise; there had\\r\\nbeen some great triumphs; there had been not a little good and pleasant\\r\\nwork; and of even the work that was less good and less pleasant one may\\r\\nsay that it at least represented experiment, and might save others from\\r\\nfailure.\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\nSCOTT AND MISS AUSTEN\\nIn 1816 Sir Thomas Bernard, baronet, barrister, and philanthropist,\\r\\npublished, having it is said written it three years previously, an\\r\\nagreeable dialogue on Old Age, which was very popular, and reached its\\r\\nfifth edition in 1820. The interlocutors are Bishops Hough and Gibson\\r\\nand Mr. Lyttleton, the supposed time 1740—the year, by accident or\\r\\ndesign, of Pamela. In this the aged and revered \"martyr of Magdalen\"\\r\\nis mildly reproached by his brother prelate for liking novels. Hough\\r\\nputs off the reproach as mildly, and in a most academic manner, by\\r\\nsaying that he only admits them speciali gratiâ. This was in fact the\\r\\ngeneral attitude to the whole kind, not merely in 1740, but after all\\r\\nthe work of nearly another life-time as long as Hough\\'s—almost in 1816\\r\\nitself. Yet when Sir Thomas published his little book, notice to quit,\\r\\nof a double kind, had been served on this fallacy. Miss Austen\\'s life\\r\\nwas nearly done, and some of her best work had not been published: but\\r\\nthe greater part had. Scott was in his actual hey-day. Between them,\\r\\nthey had dealt and were dealing—from curiously different sides and in\\r\\nas curiously different manners—the death-blow to the notion that the\\r\\nnovel was an inferior if not actually discreditable kind, suitable for\\r\\nweak intellects only, and likely to weaken strong ones, frivolous when\\r\\nnot positively immoral, giving a distaste for serious reading, implying\\r\\nin the writer an inability to do anything more serious, and generally\\r\\npresenting a glaring contrast to real \"literature.\"\\nInteresting as each of these two great novelists is individually, the\\r\\ninterest of the pair, from our present historical point of view, is\\r\\nalmost greater; and the way in which they complete each other is hardly\\r\\nshort of uncanny. Before their time, despite the great examples of prose\\r\\nfiction produced by Bunyan, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and\\r\\nSterne, and the remarkable determination towards the life of ordinary\\r\\nsociety given, or instanced, by Miss Burney; despite the immense\\r\\nnovel-production of the last half of the eighteenth century and the\\r\\nfirst decade of the nineteenth—it is hardly too much to say that \"the\\r\\nnovel,\" as such, had not found its proper way or ways at all. Bunyan\\'s\\r\\nwas an example of genius in a peculiar kind of the novel: as, in a very\\r\\ndifferent one, was Sterne\\'s. Defoe, possessing some of the rarest gifts\\r\\nof the novelist, was quite lacking in others. Richardson was not only\\r\\nexemplar vitiis imitabile and imitatum, but it might be doubted\\r\\nwhether, even when not faulty, he was not more admirable than\\r\\ndelightful. Smollett, like Defoe, was not much more than part of a\\r\\nnovelist: and Miss Burney lacked strength, equality, and range. There\\r\\nremained Fielding: and it certainly is not here that any restrictions or\\r\\nallowances will be insinuated as to Fielding\\'s praise. But Fielding\\'s\\r\\nnovels are a circle in which no one else save Thackeray has ever been\\r\\nable to walk. And what we are looking for now is something rather\\r\\ndifferent from this—a masterpiece, or masterpieces, which may not only\\r\\nyield delight and excite admiration in itself or themselves, but may\\r\\nbring forth fruit in others—fruit less masterly perhaps, but of the\\r\\nsame or a similar kind. In other words, nobody\\'s work yet—save in the\\r\\nspecial kinds—had been capable of yielding a novel-formula: nobody\\r\\nhad hit upon the most capital and fruitful novel-ideas. And nearly\\r\\neverybody had, in the kind, done work curiously and almost\\r\\nincomprehensibly faulty. Of these faults, the worst, perhaps, were\\r\\nclassable under the general head of inverisimilitude. Want of truth to\\r\\nnature in character and dialogue, extravagant and clumsy plotting,\\r\\nneglect of (indeed entire blindness to) historic colour, unreal and\\r\\nunobserved description—all these things might be raised to a height or\\r\\nsunk to a bathos in the work of the Minerva Press—but there was far too\\r\\nmuch of them in all the novel work of these sixty or seventy years.\\nAlthough the facts and dates are well enough known, it is perhaps not\\r\\nalways remembered that Miss Austen, while representing what may, using a\\r\\nrather objectionable and ambiguous word, be called a more \"modern\" style\\r\\nof novel than Scott\\'s, began long before him and had almost finished her\\r\\nwork before his really began. If that wonderful Bath bookseller had not\\r\\nkept Northanger Abbey in a drawer, instead of publishing it, it would\\r\\nhave had nearly twenty years start of Waverley. And it must be\\r\\nremembered that Northanger Abbey, though it is, perhaps, chiefly\\r\\nthought of as a parody-satire on the school of Mrs. Radcliffe, is, as\\r\\nthese parody-satires have a habit of being, a great deal more. If\\r\\nCatherine had not made a fool of herself about the Orphan of the Black\\r\\nForest and Horrid Mysteries (or rather if everything relating to this\\r\\nwere \"blacked out\" as by a Russian censor) there would still remain the\\r\\nadmirable framework of her presentation at Bath and her intercourse with\\r\\nthe Tilneys; the more admirable character-sketches of herself—the\\r\\ntriumph of the ordinary made not ordinary—and the Thorpes; the most\\r\\nadmirable flashes of satire and knowledge of human nature, not\\r\\n\"promiscuous\" or thrown out apropos of things in general, but acting\\r\\nas assistants and invigorators to the story.\\nIn the few words just used lies, as far as it can be comprehended in any\\r\\nfew words, the secret both of Miss Austen and of Scott. It has been\\r\\nsaid—more than once or twice, I fear—that hardly until Bunyan and\\r\\nDefoe do we get an interesting story—something that grasps us and\\r\\ncarries us away with it—at all. Except in the great eighteenth-century\\r\\nFour the experience is not repeated, save in parts of Miss Burney and\\r\\nMiss Edgeworth later—it is simulated rather than actually brought about\\r\\nby the Terror-novel—except in the eternal exception of Vathek—for\\r\\nMaturin did not do his best work till much later. The absence of it is\\r\\nmainly due to a concatenation of inabilities on the part of the writers.\\r\\nThey don\\'t know what they ought to do: and in a certain sense it may\\r\\neven be said that they don\\'t know what they are doing. In the worst\\r\\nexamples surveyed in the last chapter, such as A Peep at Our\\r\\nAncestors, this ignorance plumbs the abyss—blocks of dull serious\\r\\nnarrative, almost or quite without action, and occasional insertions of\\r\\nflat, insipid, and (to any one with a little knowledge) impossible\\r\\nconversation, forming their staple. Of the better class of books, from\\r\\nthe Female Quixote to Discipline, this cannot fairly be said: but\\r\\nthere is always something wanting. Frequently, as in both the books just\\r\\nmentioned, the writer is too serious and too desirous to instruct.\\r\\nHardly ever is there a real projection of character, in the round and\\r\\nliving—only pale, sketchy \"academies\" that neither live, nor move, nor\\r\\nhave any but a fitful and partial being. The conversation is, perhaps,\\r\\nthe worst feature of all—for it follows the contemporary stage in\\r\\nadopting a conventional lingo which, as we know from private letters as\\r\\nearly as Gray\\'s and Walpole\\'s, if not even as Chesterfield\\'s and those\\r\\nof men and women older still, was not the language of well-bred,\\r\\nwell-educated, and intelligent persons at any time during the century.\\r\\nAs for the Fourth Estate of the novel—description—it had rarely been\\r\\nattempted even by the great masters. In fact it has been pointed out as\\r\\nperhaps the one unquestionable merit of Mrs. Radcliffe that—following\\r\\nthe taste for the picturesque which, starting from Gray and popularised\\r\\nby Gilpin, was spreading over the country—she did attempt to introduce\\r\\nthis important feature, and did partly, in a rococo way, succeed in\\r\\nintroducing it. As for plot, that has never been our strong point—we\\r\\nseem to have been contented with Tom Jones as payment in full of that\\r\\ndemand.17\\nNow, this was all changed. It is doubtful whether if Northanger Abbey\\r\\nhad actually appeared in 1796 it would have been appreciated—Miss\\r\\nAusten, like other writers of genius, had, not exactly as the common but\\r\\nincorrect phrase goes, to create the taste for her own work, but to\\r\\narouse the long dormant appetite which she was born to satisfy. Yet,\\r\\nlooking back a hundred years, it seems impossible that anybody of wits\\r\\nshould have failed at once to discover the range, the perfection, and\\r\\nthe variety of the new gift, or set of gifts. Here all the elements come\\r\\nin: and something with them that enlivens and intensifies them all. The\\r\\nplot is not intricate, but there is a plot—good deal more, perhaps,\\r\\nthan is generally noticed, and more than Miss Austen herself sometimes\\r\\ngave, as, for instance, in Mansfield Park. It is even rather artfully\\r\\nworked out—the selfish gabble of John Thorpe, who may look to\\r\\nsuperficial observers like a mere outsider, playing an important part\\r\\ntwice in the evolution. There is not lavish but amply sufficient\\r\\ndescription and scenery—the Bath vignettes, especially the Beechencliff\\r\\nprospect; the sketch of the Abbey itself and of Henry\\'s parsonage, etc.\\r\\nBut it is in the other two constituents that the blowing of the new wind\\r\\nof the spirit is most perceptible. The character-drawing is simply\\r\\nwonderful, especially in the women—though the men lack nothing. John\\r\\nThorpe has been glanced at—there had been nothing like him before, save\\r\\nin Fielding and in the very best of the essayists and dramatists.\\r\\nGeneral Tilney has been found fault with as unnatural and excessive: but\\r\\nonly by people who do not know what \"harbitrary gents\" fathers of\\r\\nfamilies, who were not only squires and members of parliament, but\\r\\nmilitary men, could be in the eighteenth century—and perhaps a little\\r\\nlater. His son Henry, in common with most of his author\\'s jeunes\\r\\npremiers, has been similarly objected to as colourless. He really has a\\r\\ngreat deal of subdued individuality, and it had to be subdued, because\\r\\nit would not have done to let him be too superior to Catherine. James\\r\\nMorland and Frederick Tilney are not to be counted as more than \"walking\\r\\ngentlemen,\" Mr. Allen only as a little more: and they fulfil their law.\\r\\nBut Isabella Thorpe is almost better than her brother, as being nearer\\r\\nto pure comedy and further from farce; Eleanor Tilney is adequate; and\\r\\nMrs. Allen is sublime on her scale. A novelist who, at the end of the\\r\\neighteenth century, could do Mrs. Allen, could do anything that she\\r\\nchose to do; and might be trusted never to attempt anything that she\\r\\ncould not achieve. And yet the heroine is perhaps—as she ought to\\r\\nbe—the greatest triumph of the whole, and the most indicative of the\\r\\nnew method. The older heroines had generally tried to be extraordinary:\\r\\nand had failed. Catherine tries to be ordinary: and is an extraordinary\\r\\nsuccess. She is pretty, but not beautiful: sensible and well-natured,\\r\\nbut capable, like most of us, of making a complete fool of herself and\\r\\nof doing complete injustice to other people; fairly well educated, but\\r\\nnot in the least learned or accomplished. In real life she would be\\r\\nsimply a unit in the thousands of quite nice but ordinary girls whom\\r\\nProvidence providentially provides in order that mankind shall not be\\r\\nalone. In literature she is more precious than rubies—exactly because\\r\\nart has so masterfully followed and duplicated nature.\\nPrecisely to what extent the attractive quality of this art is enhanced\\r\\nby the pervading irony of the treatment would be a very difficult\\r\\nproblem to work out. It is scarcely hazardous to say that irony is the\\r\\nvery salt of the novel: and that just as you put salt even in a cake, so\\r\\nit is not wise to neglect it wholly even in a romance. Life itself, as\\r\\nsoon as it gets beyond mere vegetation, is notoriously full of irony:\\r\\nand no imitation of it which dispenses with the seasoning can be worth\\r\\nmuch. That Miss Austen\\'s irony is consummate can hardly be said to be\\r\\nmatter of serious contest.\\nIt has sometimes been thought—perhaps mistakenly—that the exhibition\\r\\nof it in Northanger Abbey is, though a very creditable essay, not\\r\\nconsummate. But Pride and Prejudice is known to be, in part, little if\\r\\nat all later than Northanger Abbey: and there can again be very little\\r\\ndispute among judges in any way competent as to the quality of the irony\\r\\nthere. Nor does it much matter what part of this wonderful book was\\r\\nwritten later and what earlier: for its ironical character is\\r\\nall-pervading, in almost every character, except Jane and her lover who\\r\\nare mere foils to Elizabeth and Darcy, and even in these to some extent;\\r\\nand in the whole story, even in the at least permitted suggestion that\\r\\nthe sight of Pemberley, and Darcy\\'s altered demeanour, had something to\\r\\ndo with Elizabeth\\'s resignation of the old romantic part of Belle dame\\r\\nsans merci. It may further be admitted, even by those who protest\\r\\nagainst the undervaluation of Northanger Abbey, that Pride and\\r\\nPrejudice flies higher, and maintains its flight triumphantly. It is\\r\\nnot only longer; it is not only quite independent of parody or contrast\\r\\nwith something previous; but it is far more intricate and elaborate as\\r\\nwell as more original. Elizabeth herself is not merely an ordinary girl:\\r\\nand the putting forward of her, as an extraordinary yet in no single\\r\\npoint unnatural one, is victoriously carried out. Her father, in spite\\r\\nof (nay, perhaps, including) his comparative collapse when he is called\\r\\nupon, not as before to talk but to act, in the business of Lydia\\'s\\r\\nflight, is a masterpiece. Mr. Collins is, once more by common consent of\\r\\nthe competent, unsurpassed, if not peerless: those who think him\\r\\nunnatural simply do not know nature. Shakespeare and Fielding were the\\r\\nonly predecessors who could properly serve as sponsors to \"this young\\r\\nlady\" (as Scott delightfully calls her) on her introduction among the\\r\\nimmortals on the strength of this character alone. Lady Catherine is not\\r\\nmuch the inferior (it would have been pleasing to tell her so) of her\\r\\nprotégé and chaplain. Of almost all the characters, and of quite the\\r\\nwhole book, it is scarcely extravagant to say that it could not have\\r\\nbeen better on its own scale and scheme—that it is difficult to\\r\\nconceive any scheme and scale on which it could have been better. And,\\r\\nyet once more, there is nothing out of the way in it—the only thing not\\r\\nof absolutely everyday occurrence, the elopement of Lydia, happens on\\r\\nso many days still, with slight variations, that it can hardly be called\\r\\na licence.\\nThe same qualities appear throughout the other books, whether in more or\\r\\nless quintessence and with less or more alloy is a question rather of\\r\\nindividual taste than for general or final critical decision. Sense and\\r\\nSensibility, the first actually to appear (1811), is believed to have\\r\\nbeen written about the same time as Pride and Prejudice, which\\r\\nappeared two years later, and Northanger Abbey, which did not see the\\r\\nlight till its author was dead. It is the weakest of the three—perhaps\\r\\nit is the weakest of all: but the weakness is due rather to an error of\\r\\njudgment than to a lack of power. Like Northanger Abbey it has a\\r\\ncertain dependence on something else: the extravagances of Marianne\\r\\nsatirise the Sensibility-novel just as those of Catherine do the\\r\\nTerror-story of the immediate past. But it is on a much larger scale:\\r\\nand things of the kind are better in miniature. Moreover, the author\\'s\\r\\nsense of creative faculty made her try to throw up and contrast her\\r\\nheroine with other characters, in a way which she had not attempted in\\r\\nNorthanger Abbey: and good as these are in themselves, they make a\\r\\nless perfect whole. Indeed, in the order of thought, Sense and\\r\\nSensibility is the \"youngest\" of the novels—the least self-criticised.\\r\\nNothing in it shows lack of power (John Dashwood and his wife are of the\\r\\nfirst order); a good deal in it shows lack of knowledge exactly how to\\r\\ndirect that power.\\nMansfield Park (1814), though hardly as brilliant as Pride and\\r\\nPrejudice, shows much more maturity than Sense and Sensibility. Much\\r\\nof it is quite consummate, the character of Mrs. Norris especially: and\\r\\nfor subtly interwoven phrase without emphasis, conveying knowledge and\\r\\ncriticism of life, it has few equals. But it has an elopement. Emma,\\r\\nwhich has perhaps on the whole been the most general favourite, may\\r\\nchallenge that position on one ground beyond all question, though\\r\\npossibly not on all. It is the absolute triumph of that reliance on the\\r\\nstrictly ordinary which has been indicated as Miss Austen\\'s title to\\r\\npre-eminence in the history of the novel. Not an event, not a\\r\\ncircumstance, not a detail, is carried out of \"the daily round, the\\r\\ncommon task\" of average English middle-class humanity, upper and lower.\\r\\nYet every event, every circumstance, every detail, is put sub specie\\r\\neternitatis by the sorcery of art. Few things could be more\\r\\nterrible—nothing more tiresome—than to hear the garrulous Miss Bates\\r\\ntalk in actual life; few things are more delightful than to read her\\r\\nspeeches as they occur here. An aspiring soul might feel disposed to\\r\\n\"take and drown itself in a pail\" (as one of Dickens\\'s characters says)\\r\\nif it had to live the life which the inhabitants of Highbury are\\r\\nrepresented as living; to read about that life—to read about it over\\r\\nand over again—has been and is always likely to be one of the chosen\\r\\ndelights of some of the best wits of our race. This is one of the\\r\\nparadoxes of art: and perhaps it is the most wonderful of them,\\r\\nexceeding even the old \"pity and terror\" problem. And the discovery of\\r\\nit, as a possible source of artistic success, is one of the greatest\\r\\ntriumphs and one of the most inexhaustible discoveries of that art\\r\\nitself. For by another paradox—this time not of art but of nature—the\\r\\nextraordinary is exhaustible and the ordinary is not. Tragedy and the\\r\\nmore \"incidented\" comedy, it is well known, run into types and reproduce\\r\\nsituations almost inevitably. \"All the stories are told.\" But the story\\r\\nof the life of Highbury never can be told, because there is really\\r\\nnothing in it but the telling: and here the blessed infinity of Art\\r\\ncomes in again.\\nMiss Austen\\'s last book, like her first, was published posthumously and\\r\\nshe left nothing else but a couple of fragments. One of these, Lady\\r\\nSusan, does not, so far as it extends, promise much, though it is such\\r\\na fragment and such an evident first draft even of this, that judgment\\r\\nof it is equally unfair and futile. The other, The Watsons, has some\\r\\nvery striking touches, but is also a mere beginning. Persuasion—which\\r\\nappeared with Northanger Abbey and which, curiously enough, has, like\\r\\nits nearly twenty years elder sister, Bath for its principal scene—has\\r\\nalso some pretensions to primacy among the books, and is universally\\r\\nadmitted to be of its author\\'s most delicate, most finished, and most\\r\\nsustained work. And this, like Emma, resolutely abstains from even the\\r\\nslightest infusion of startling or unusual incident, of \"exciting\"\\r\\nstory, of glaring colour of any kind: relying only on congruity of\\r\\nspeech, sufficient if subdued description, and above all a profusion of\\r\\nthe most delicately, but the most vividly drawn character, made to\\r\\nunfold a plot which has interest, if no excitement, and seasoned\\r\\nthroughout with the unfailing condiment—the author\\'s \"own sauce\"—of\\r\\ngentle but piquant irony and satire.\\nIt is not to be supposed or inferred that Miss Austen\\'s methods, or her\\r\\nresults, have appealed to everybody. Madame de Staël thought her\\r\\nvulgaire—meaning, of course, not exactly our \"vulgar\" but\\r\\n\"commonplace\"; Charlotte Brontë was not much otherwise minded; her own\\r\\nMarianne Dashwood would doubtless have thought the same. Readers without\\r\\nsome touch of letters may think her style old-fashioned: it has even\\r\\nbeen termed \"stilted.\" Not merely may amateurs of blood and thunder, of\\r\\npassion and sensation, think her tame, but the more modern devotees of\\r\\n\"analysis\" may consider her superficial. On the other hand, it is\\r\\nnotorious that, from her own day to this, she has never wanted\\r\\npartisans, often of superlative competence, and of the most strikingly\\r\\ndifferent tempers, tastes, and opinions. The extraordinary quietness of\\r\\nher art is only matched by its confidence: its subtlety by its strength.\\r\\nShe did not try many styles; she deliberately and no doubt wisely\\r\\nrefused to try the other style which was already carrying all before it\\r\\nin her own later days. She seems to have confined herself (with what\\r\\nseems to some high-flying judges an almost ignoble caution) to the\\r\\nstrata of society that she knew most thoroughly: and the curious have\\r\\nnoted that she seldom goes above a baronet, and hardly even descends to\\r\\na butler, in her range of personages who are not mere mutes. It is not\\r\\nat all unlikely—in fact it is almost certain—that she might have\\r\\nenlarged this range, and that of her incident, with perfect safety and\\r\\nto the great profit and delight of her readers. But these actual things\\r\\nshe knew she could do consummately; and she would not risk the\\r\\nproduction of anything not consummate.\\nThe value of her, artistically, is of course in the perfection of what\\r\\nshe did; but the value of her historically is in the way in which she\\r\\nshowed that, given the treatment, any material could be perfected. It\\r\\nwas in this way, as has been pointed out, that the possibilities of the\\r\\nnovel were shown to be practically illimitable. Tragedy is not needed:\\r\\nand the most ordinary transactions, the most everyday characters,\\r\\ndevelop into an infinite series of comedies with which the novelist can\\r\\namuse himself and his readers. The ludicrum humani seculi on the one\\r\\nhand, and the artist\\'s power of extracting and arranging it on the\\r\\nother—these two things supply all that is wanted. This Hampshire\\r\\nparson\\'s daughter had found the philosopher\\'s stone of the novel: and\\r\\nthe very pots and pans, the tongs and pokers of the house, could be\\r\\nturned into novel-gold by it.\\nBut even gold is not everything: and only a fanatic, and a rather\\r\\nfoolish fanatic, would say that this style of fiction summed up and\\r\\nexhausted all the good that fiction could give and do. Miss Austen\\'s art\\r\\nexcludes (it has been said) tragedy; it does not let in much pure\\r\\nromance; although its variety is in a way infinite, yet it is not\\r\\nvarious in infinite ways, but rather in very finite ones. Everybody who\\r\\ndenies its excellence is to be blamed: but nobody is to be blamed for\\r\\nsaying that he should like some other excellences as well. The desire is\\r\\ninnocent, nay commendable: and it was being satisfied, at practically\\r\\nthe same time, by the work of Sir Walter Scott in a kind of novel almost\\r\\nas new (when we regard it in connection with its earlier examples) as\\r\\nMiss Austen\\'s own. This was the Historical novel, which, in a way, not\\r\\nonly subsumed many though not quite all varieties of Romance, but also\\r\\nsummoned to its aid not a little—in fact a very great deal—of the\\r\\nmethods of the pure novel itself.\\nIt is not very long since a critic, probably not very old, sentenced the\\r\\ncritical opinions of another critic, certainly not very young, to \"go\\r\\ninto the melting pot\" because they were in favour of the historical\\r\\nnovel: and because the historical novel had for some time past done\\r\\ngreat harm (I think the phrase was stronger) to the imaginative\\r\\nliterature of England. Now there are several things which might be said\\r\\nabout this judgment—I do not say \"in arrest\" of it, because it is of\\r\\nitself inoperative: as it happens you cannot put critical opinions in\\r\\nthe melting pot. At least, they won\\'t melt: and they come out again\\r\\nlike the diabolic rat that Mr. Chips tried to pitch-boil. In the first\\r\\nplace, there is the question whether the greater part by far of the\\r\\nimaginative and other literature of any time does not itself \"go into\\r\\nthe melting pot,\" and whether it much matters what sends it there. In\\r\\nthe second, if this seems too cynical, there is the very large and grave\\r\\nquestion whether a still larger proportion of the novel of manners, in\\r\\nEngland, France, and all other countries during the same time, has not\\r\\nbeen as bad as, or worse than, the romantic division, historical or\\r\\nother. But the worst faults of the judgment remain. In the first place\\r\\nthere is the fatal shortness of view. It is with the literature of two\\r\\nthousand, not with the literature of twenty, years that the true critic\\r\\nhas to do: and no kind which—in two thousand, or two hundred, or\\r\\ntwenty—has produced literature that is good or great can be even\\r\\ntemporarily put aside because (as every kind of literature without\\r\\nexception has been again and again) it is for a time barren or fruitful\\r\\nonly in weeds. And any one who does not count Scott and Dumas and\\r\\nThackeray among the makers of good literature must really excuse others\\r\\nif they simply take no further count of him. The historical novel is a\\r\\ngood kind, good friends, a marvellous good kind: and it has the\\r\\nadvantage over the pure novel of manners that it is much less subject to\\r\\nobsolescence, if it be really well done; while it can practically annex\\r\\nmost of the virtues of that novel of manners itself.\\nThis excellent kind, however, had been wandering about in the\\r\\nwilderness—had indeed hardly got so far even as that stage, but had\\r\\nbeen a mere \"bodiless childful of life in the gloom\"—for more than two\\r\\nthousand years before Waverley. Of its earlier attempts to get into\\r\\nfull existence we cannot say much here:18 something on the more\\r\\nrecent but rather abortive birth-throes has been promised, and is now\\r\\ndue. It is not improbable that considerable assistance was rendered to\\r\\nthe kind by the heroic romance of the seventeenth century in prose and\\r\\nverse, which often attempted historic, and almost always\\r\\npseudo-historic, guise. As has been seen in regard to such collections\\r\\nas Croxall\\'s, historical stories were freely mingled with fictitious:\\r\\nand it could not be for nothing that Horace Walpole, the author of the\\r\\nCastle of Otranto, was a rather ardent and even to some extent\\r\\nscholarly student of the romance and the gossip of history. Much\\r\\nearlier, Fielding himself, in his salad days, had given something of an\\r\\nhistoric turn to the story of A Journey from this World to the Next.\\r\\nAnd when history itself became more common and more readable, it could\\r\\nnot but be that this inexhaustible source of material for the new kind\\r\\nof literature, which was being so eagerly demanded and so busily\\r\\nsupplied, should suggest itself. Some instances of late eighteenth and\\r\\nearly nineteenth century experiments have been given and discussed in\\r\\nthe last chapter: and when Scott (or \"the Author of Waverley\") had\\r\\nachieved his astonishing success, some of the writers of these put in\\r\\nthe usual claim of \"That\\'s my thunder.\" This was done in the case of\\r\\nthe Lees, it was also done in the case of Jane Porter, the writer of\\r\\nthe once famous and favourite Thaddeus of Warsaw (1803) and Scottish\\r\\nChiefs (1810): while, as we have seen, there had been historical colour\\r\\nenough in Godwin\\'s novels to make suggestion of his \"authorship of\\r\\nWaverley\" not absolutely preposterous. Even Mrs. Radcliffe had touched\\r\\nthe style; and humbler persons like the egregious Henrietta Mosse had\\r\\nattempted it in the most serious spirit.\\nBut with their varying degrees of talent—with, in one or two cases,\\r\\neven a little genius—all these writers had broken themselves upon one\\r\\nfatal difficulty—that of anachronism: not in the petty sense of the\\r\\npedant, but in the wide one of the critic. The present writer is not\\r\\nprepared, without reading A Peep at Our Ancestors again (which he\\r\\ndistinctly declines to do), to say that there are, in that remarkable\\r\\nperformance, any positive errors of historic fact worse than, or as bad,\\r\\nas those which pedantry has pointed out in Ivanhoe. But whereas you\\r\\nmay be nearly as well acquainted with the actual history of the time as\\r\\nthe pedants themselves, and a great deal better acquainted with its\\r\\nliterature, and yet never be shocked, disgusted, or contemptuously\\r\\namused in Ivanhoe by such things as were quoted from the Peep a few\\r\\npages back—so, to those who know something of \"the old Elizabeth way,\"\\r\\nand even nowadays to those who know very little, and that little at\\r\\nsecond hand, Miss Lee\\'s travesty of it in The Recess is impossible and\\r\\nintolerable. When Mrs. Radcliffe, at the date definitely given of 1584,\\r\\ntalks about \"the Parisian opera,\" represents a French girl of the\\r\\nsixteenth century as being \"instructed in the English poets,\" and talks\\r\\nabout driving in a \"landau,\" the individual blunders are, perhaps, not\\r\\nmore violent than those of the chronology by which Scott\\'s Ulrica is\\r\\napparently a girl at the time of the Conquest and a woman, not too old\\r\\nto be the object of rivalry between Front de Boeuf and his father, not\\r\\nlong before the reign of Richard I. But this last oversight does not\\r\\naffect the credibility of the story, or the homogeneity of the manners,\\r\\nin the least. Mrs. Radcliffe jumbles up two (or more than two) utterly\\r\\ndifferent states and stages of society, manners, and other things which\\r\\nconstitute the very atmosphere of the story itself. Perhaps (we have\\r\\nvery few easy conversations of the period to justify a positive\\r\\nstatement) a real Bois-Guilbert and still more a real Wamba might not\\r\\nhave talked exactly like Scott\\'s personages: but there is no insistent\\r\\nand disturbing reason why they should not. When we hear an Adelaise of\\r\\nthe mid-twelfth century asking whether she does not receive her\\r\\neducation from her mamma, the necessary \"suspension of disbelief\"\\r\\nbecomes impossible.\\nBut these now most obvious truths were not obvious at all between 1780\\r\\nand 1810: and it is perhaps the greatest evidence of Scott\\'s genius that\\r\\nhalf, but by no means quite, unconsciously he saw them, and that he has\\r\\nmade everybody see them since. It was undoubtedly fortunate that he\\r\\nbegan novel-writing so late: for earlier even he might have been caught\\r\\nin the errors of the time. But when he did begin, he had not only\\r\\nreached middle life and matured his considerable original critical\\r\\nfaculty—criticism and wine are the only things that even the \"kind calm\\r\\nyears\" may be absolutely trusted to improve if there is any original\\r\\ngoodness in them—but he had other advantages. He had read, if not with\\r\\nminute accuracy, very widely indeed: and he possessed, as Lord Morley\\r\\nhas well said, \"the genius of history\" in a degree which perhaps no\\r\\nmerely meticulous scholar has ever reached, and which was not exceeded\\r\\nin quality even by the greatest historians such as Gibbon. He had an\\r\\nalmost unmatched combination of common sense with poetic imagination, of\\r\\nknowledge of the world with knowledge of letters. He had shown himself\\r\\nto be possessed of the secret of semi-historical narrative itself in\\r\\nhalf a dozen remarkable verse romances, and therefore had less to do in\\r\\nengineering the prose romance. Last of all, he had seen what to\\r\\navoid—not merely in his editing of Strutt\\'s Queenhoo Hall (a valuable\\r\\nproperty-room for the novel, but nothing of a real novel), but in his\\r\\nreading of the failures of his predecessors and contemporaries. The very\\r\\nbeginning of Waverley itself (which most people skip) is invaluable,\\r\\nbecause it shows us that at the time he wrote it (which, it need hardly\\r\\nbe said, was a long time before its completion) he had not the knowledge\\r\\nor the courage to strike straight out into the stream of action and\\r\\nconversation, but troubled himself with accumulating bladders and\\r\\narranging ropes for the possible salvation of his narrative if it got\\r\\ninto difficulties. Very soon he knew that it would not get into\\r\\ndifficulties: and away he went.\\nIt ought not to be necessary, but from some symptoms it may be\\r\\ndesirable, to point out that Scott is very far from being an historical\\r\\nnovelist only. An acute French critic, well acquainted with both\\r\\nliteratures, once went so far as to say that there were a good many\\r\\nprofessed \"philosophical\" novels which did not contain such keen\\r\\npsychology as Scott\\'s: and I would undertake to show a good deal of\\r\\ncause on this side. But short of it, it is undeniable that he can do\\r\\nperfectly well without any historical scaffolding. There is practically\\r\\nnothing of it in his second and third novels, Guy Mannering and The\\r\\nAntiquary, each of which good judges have sometimes ranked as his very\\r\\nbest: there is as little or less in St. Ronan\\'s Well, a very fine\\r\\nthing as it is, and one which, but for James Ballantyne\\'s meddling folly\\r\\nand prudery, would have been much finer. The incomparable little\\r\\nconversation—scenes and character-sketches scattered among the\\r\\nIntroductions to the novels—especially the history of Crystal\\r\\nCroftangry—show that he could perfectly well have dispensed with all\\r\\nout-of-the-way incident had he chosen. But, as a rule, he did not so\\r\\nchoose: and, in the majority of cases, he preferred to take his\\r\\nout-of-the-way incident from historical sources. Not here,\\r\\nunfortunately, can we allow ourselves even a space proportionate to that\\r\\ngiven above in Miss Austen\\'s case to the criticism of individual novels:\\r\\nbut luckily there is not much need of this. The brilliant overture of\\r\\nWaverley as such, with its entirely novel combination of the\\r\\nhistorical and the \"national\" elements upon the still more novel\\r\\nbackground of Highland scenery; the equally vivid and vigorous narrative\\r\\nand the more interesting personages of Old Mortality and Rob Roy;\\r\\nthe domestic tragedy, with the historical element for little more than a\\r\\nframework, of the Heart of Midlothian and the Bride of Lammermoor;\\r\\nthe little masterpiece of A Legend of Montrose; the fresh departure,\\r\\nwith purely English subject, of Ivanhoe and its triumphant sequels in\\r\\nKenilworth, Quentin Durward, and others; the striking utilisation of\\r\\nliterary assistance in the Fortunes of Nigel; and the wonderful\\r\\nblending of autobiographic, historical, and romantic interest in\\r\\nRedgauntlet:—one cannot dwell on these and other things. The magic\\r\\ncontinued even in Woodstock—written as this was almost between the\\r\\nblows of the executioner\\'s crow-bar on the wheel, in the tightening of\\r\\nthe windlasses at the rack—it is not absent, whatever people may say,\\r\\nin Anne of Geierstein, nor even quite lacking in the better parts of\\r\\nCount Robert of Paris. But we must not expatiate on its effects; we\\r\\nmust only give a little attention to the means by which they are\\r\\nachieved.\\nAnother of the common errors about Scott is to represent—perhaps really\\r\\nto regard—him as a hit-or-miss and hand-to-mouth improvisatore, who\\r\\nbundled out his creations anyhow, and did not himself know how he\\r\\ncreated them. The fallacy is worse than a fallacy: for it is down-right\\r\\nfalse witness. We have numerous passages in and out of the novels—the\\r\\nchief of them being the remarkable conversation with Captain Clutterbuck\\r\\nin the Introduction to the Fortunes of Nigel and the reflections in\\r\\nthe Diary on Sir John Chiverton and Brambletye House—showing that\\r\\nScott knew perfectly well the construction and the stringing of his\\r\\nfiddle, as well as the trick of applying his rosin. But if we had not\\r\\nthese direct testimonies, no one of any critical faculty could mistake\\r\\nthe presence of consciously perceived principles in the books\\r\\nthemselves. A man does not suddenly, and by mere blind instinct, avoid\\r\\nsuch a pitfall as that of incongruous speech and manners, which has been\\r\\nnoticed above. It is not mere happy-go-lucky blundering which makes him\\r\\ninvariably decline another into which people still fall—the selection\\r\\nof historical personages of the first importance, and elaborately known,\\r\\nfor the central figures of his novels. Not to believe in luck is a\\r\\nmark of perhaps greater folly than to over-believe in it: but luck will\\r\\nnot always keep a man clear of such perils as that unskilful wedging of\\r\\ngreat blocks of mere history into his story, which the lesser historical\\r\\nnovelists always commit, or that preponderance of mere narrative itself\\r\\nas compared with action and conversation from which even Dumas, even\\r\\nThackeray, is not free.\\nThat he knew what he was doing and what he had to do is thus certain;\\r\\nthat he did it to an astounding extent is still more certain; but it\\r\\nwould not skill much to deny that he did not always give himself time to\\r\\ndo it perfectly in every respect, though it is perhaps not mere paradox\\r\\nor mere partisanship to suggest that if he had given himself more time,\\r\\nhe would hardly have done better, and might have done worse. The\\r\\naccusation of superficiality has been already glanced at: and it is\\r\\npretty certain that it argues more superficiality, of a much more\\r\\nhopeless kind, in those who make it. The accusation of careless and\\r\\nslovenly style is not much better: for Scott had, perfectly, the style\\r\\nsuited to his own work, and you cannot easily have a better style than\\r\\nthat. But there are two defects in him which were early detected by good\\r\\nand friendly judges: and which are in fact natural results of the\\r\\nextraordinary force and fertility of his creative power. One—the less\\r\\nserious, but certainly to some extent a fault in art and a point in\\r\\nwhich he is distinguished for the worse from Shakespeare—is that he is\\r\\nrather given to allow at first, to some of his personages, an\\r\\nelaborateness and apparent emphasis of drawing which seems to promise an\\r\\nimportance for them in the story that they never actually attain. Mike\\r\\nLambourne in Kenilworth is a good example of this: but there are many\\r\\nothers. The fact evidently was that, in the rush of the artist\\'s plastic\\r\\nimagination, other figures rose and overpowered these. It is an excuse:\\r\\nbut it is hardly a justification. The other and more serious is a\\r\\ntendency—which grew on him and may no doubt have been encouraged by the\\r\\nastonishing pecuniary rewards of his work—to hurry his conclusions, to\\r\\n\"huddle up the cards and throw them into the bag,\" as Lady Louisa Stuart\\r\\ntold him. There is one of the numerous, but it would seem generic and\\r\\nclassifiable, forms of unpleasant dream in which the dreamer\\'s watch, to\\r\\nhis consternation, suddenly begins to send its hands round at double and\\r\\nten-fold speed. Scott is rather apt to do this, towards the close of his\\r\\nnovels, in his eagerness to begin something else. These defects,\\r\\nhowever, are defects much more from the point of view of abstract\\r\\ncriticism than from that of the pleasure of the reader: while, even from\\r\\nthe former, they are outweighed many times by merits. And as regards our\\r\\npresent method of estimation, they hardly count at all.\\nFor, in that calculus, the important thing is that Scott, like Miss\\r\\nAusten, at once opened an immense new field to the novelist, and showed\\r\\nhow that field was to be cultivated. The complement-contrast of the pair\\r\\ncan need emphasising only to those on whom no emphasis would be likely\\r\\nto impress it: but it may not be quite so evident at once that between\\r\\nthem they cover almost the entire possible ground of prose fiction. The\\r\\nmore striking and popular as well as more strictly novel style of Scott\\r\\nnaturally attracted most attention at first: indeed it can hardly be\\r\\nsaid that, for the next thirty years, much attempt was made to follow in\\r\\nMiss Austen\\'s steps, while such attempts as were made were seldom very\\r\\ngood.19 But there is no need to hurry Time: and he generally knows\\r\\nwhat he is about. At any rate he had, in and through these two\\r\\nprovided—for generations, probably for centuries, to come—patterns and\\r\\nprinciples for whoso would to follow in prose fiction.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\nTHE SUCCESSORS—TO THACKERAY\\nA person inexperienced in the ways of life and literature might expect\\r\\nthat such developments as those surveyed and discussed in the last\\r\\nchapter must have immediate and unbroken development further. Scott had\\r\\nthrown open, and made available, the whole vast range of history for the\\r\\nromancer: Miss Austen had shown the infinite possibilities of ordinary\\r\\nand present things for the novelist. And such a one might contend that,\\r\\neven if the common idea of definite precursorship and teachership be a\\r\\nmistake, the more subtle doctrine that such work as Scott\\'s, and as Miss\\r\\nAusten\\'s, is really the result of generally working forces, as well as\\r\\nof individual genius, would lead to the same conclusion. But the\\r\\nexpectation would show his inexperience, and his ignorance of the fact\\r\\nthat Art, unlike Science, declines to be bound by any calculable laws\\r\\nwhatsoever.\\nIt was indeed impossible that Scott\\'s towering fame should not draw the\\r\\nnobler sort, and his immense gains the baser, to follow in his track:\\r\\nand they promptly did so. But, as he himself quoted in the remarkable\\r\\ncomments (above alluded to) on his early imitators in the Diary, they\\r\\nhad \"gotten his fiddle, but not his rosin\"—an observation the truth of\\r\\nwhich may be shown presently. Miss Austen\\'s immediate influence in the\\r\\nother direction was almost nil: and this was hardly to be regretted,\\r\\nbecause a tolerably stationary state of manners, language, etc., such\\r\\nas her kind of novel requires, had not quite, though it had nearly, been\\r\\nreached. At any rate, the kind of ebb or half ebb, which so often,\\r\\nthough not so certainly, follows flood-tides in literature, came upon\\r\\nthe novel in the twenties and thirties. Even the striking appearance of\\r\\nDickens and Pickwick in 1837 can hardly be said to have turned it\\r\\ndistinctly: for the Dickensian novel is a species by itself—neither\\r\\nstrictly novel nor strictly romance, but, as Polonius might say, a\\r\\npicaresque-burlesque-sentimental-farcical-realist-fantastic nondescript.\\r\\nNot till Vanity Fair did the novel of pure real life advance its\\r\\nstandard once more: while the historical novel-romance of a new kind may\\r\\ndate its revival with—though it should scarcely trace that revival\\r\\nto—Esmond, or Westward Ho! or both.\\nBetween Scott on the earlier side and Dickens and Thackeray on the\\r\\nother, there was an immense production of novels, illustrated by not a\\r\\nfew names which should rank high in the second class, while some would\\r\\npromote more than one of them to the first. The lines of development, as\\r\\nwell as the chief individual practitioners, may be best indicated by\\r\\nshort discussions of Hook, Bulwer, Disraeli, Ainsworth, James, Marryat,\\r\\nand Peacock.\\nThe most probable demur to this list is likely to be taken at the very\\r\\nfirst name. Theodore Hook has had no return of the immense popularity\\r\\nwhich his Sayings and Doings (1826-1829) obtained for him; nor,\\r\\nperhaps, is he ever likely to have any; nor yet, further, save in one\\r\\nrespect, can he be said to deserve it. Flimsily constructed, hastily\\r\\nwritten, reflecting indeed the ways and speech of the time after a\\r\\nfashion, but in a distorted mirror and with a thin and superficial\\r\\nrepresentation, nearer to bad drama than to good literature, full of\\r\\nhorseplay and forced high jinks—his stories have all the inseparable\\r\\nfaults of improvisation together with those of art that is out of\\r\\nfashion and manners-painting (such as it is) of manners that are dead,\\r\\nand when alive were those of a not very picturesque, pleasing, or\\r\\nrespectable transition. Yet, for all this, Hook has a claim on the\\r\\ncritical historian of literature, and especially of the novel, which has\\r\\nbeen far too little acknowledged. And this claim does not even consist\\r\\nin the undoubted fact that his influence both on Dickens and on\\r\\nThackeray was direct and very great. It lies in the larger and more\\r\\nimportant, though connected, fact that, at a given moment, his were the\\r\\nhands in which the torch of the novel-procession was deposited. He\\r\\nstands to fiction almost exactly as Leigh Hunt stands to the\\r\\nmiscellaneous essay. He modernised and multiplied its subjects,\\r\\nattractions, appeals: he \"vulgarised\" it in the partly good French\\r\\nsense, as well as in the wholly bad English one; he was its journalist\\r\\nand colporteur. He broke up the somewhat stock-and-type moulds of\\r\\neighteenth-century tale-telling; admitted a plurality, almost an\\r\\ninfinity, of interest and incident; gave a sort of universal franchise\\r\\nto possible subjects of novel; and (perhaps most important of all)\\r\\nbanished from that novel the tendency to conventional \"lingo\" which,\\r\\nthough never so prevalent in it as in eighteenth-century drama, had\\r\\nexisted. It may seem to some readers that there is an exaggerated and\\r\\nparadoxical opposition between this high praise and the severe censure\\r\\npronounced a little above—that both cannot be true. But both are true:\\r\\nand it is a really natural and necessary cause and proof at once of\\r\\ntheir truth that Hook never wrote a really good novel, hardly even a\\r\\nreally good tale (\"Gervase Skinner\" is probably the best), and yet that\\r\\nhe deserves the place here given to him.\\nAinsworth and James perhaps deserve to be taken next, not so much in\\r\\npoint of merit as because both, though continuing (especially Ainsworth)\\r\\nvery late, began pretty early. Indeed, a book in which Ainsworth had a\\r\\nhand, though it is said to be not wholly his, Sir John Chiverton, was\\r\\nwith Horace Smith\\'s Brambletye House (1826), the actual subject of\\r\\nScott\\'s criticism above quoted. Both Ainsworth and James are unconcealed\\r\\nfollowers of Scott himself: and they show the dangers to which the\\r\\nhistorical romance is exposed when it gets out of the hands of genius.\\r\\nOf the two, James had the greater scholarship, the better command of\\r\\nEnglish, and perhaps a nearer approach to command also of character:\\r\\nAinsworth more \"fire in his interior,\" more variety, somewhat more\\r\\nhumour (though neither was strong in this respect), and a certain not\\r\\nuseless or despicable faculty of splashy scene-painting and rough but\\r\\nnot ineffective stage-management. But of Scott\\'s combination of poetry,\\r\\nhumour, knowledge of life, reading, grasp of character, and command of\\r\\neffective dialogue and description, both were utterly destitute: and\\r\\nboth fell into the mistake (which even Dumas did not wholly avoid) of\\r\\nattempting to give the historical effect by thrusting in lardings of\\r\\npure history, by overloading descriptions of dress, etc., and, in short,\\r\\nby plastering the historic colour on, instead of suffusing it, as Scott\\r\\nhad managed to do. Popular as they were, not merely with youthful\\r\\nreaders, they undoubtedly brought the historical novel into some\\r\\ndiscredit a little before the middle of the century.20\\nWith Bulwer and Disraeli we get into a different sphere of\\r\\nliterature—whether into the same in both cases, and whether, if so,\\r\\ninto one of the highest, are questions on which no general agreement has\\r\\nyet been reached—on which, perhaps, no general agreement is even\\r\\npossible.\\nWith regard to the second, it must be remembered that to him, whether as\\r\\nMr. Disraeli or as Lord Beaconsfield, novel-writing was always a\\r\\n\"by-work\"—partly a means to his real end of politics, partly a\\r\\nrelaxation from the work necessary to that end. He called himself a\\r\\n\"gentleman of the press\"—with that mixture of sincerity, purpose, and\\r\\nironical simulation which brought on him, from unintelligent or not very\\r\\nhonest opponents, and even from others, the charge of affectation, if\\r\\nnot of hypocrisy. And, undoubtedly, he did a good deal of work for the\\r\\npress, and very remarkable work too—almost wholly in the kind of\\r\\nnovel-writing, from Vivian Grey (1826) to Endymion (1880). Yet it\\r\\nmay be permitted—in the face of some more than respectable opinion on\\r\\nthe other side—to doubt whether, except in some curious sports and\\r\\nby-products, he ever produced real novel-work of the highest class. In\\r\\nthe satiric-fantastic tale—in a kind of following of Voltaire—such as\\r\\nIxion, he has hardly a superior, unless it be Anthony Hamilton, who is\\r\\nthe superior of Voltaire himself and the master of everybody. For a pure\\r\\nlove-novel of a certain kind, Henrietta Temple (1837) is bad to\\r\\nbeat—and in a curious cross between the historical, biographical, and\\r\\nthe romantic, Venetia (same year) also stands pretty much alone. But\\r\\nall the rest, more or less political, more or less \"of society,\" more or\\r\\nless fantastic—Coningsby (1844) as well as Alroy (1833), Tancred\\r\\n(1847) as well as Vivian Grey, Sybil (1845), as well as The Young\\r\\nDuke (1831), \"leave to desire\" in a strange way. Like the three which\\r\\nhave been excepted for praise, each is in a manner sui generis, while\\r\\nthe whole group stands, in a manner also, apart from others and by\\r\\nitself. There is astonishing cleverness everywhere, in regard to almost\\r\\nevery point of novel-composition, though with special regard to\\r\\nepigrammatic phrase. But the whole is inorganic somehow, and more than\\r\\nsomehow unreal; without (save in the cases mentioned) attaining that\\r\\nobviously unreal but persuasive phantasmagoria which some great writers\\r\\nof fiction have managed to put in existence and motion. How far this is\\r\\ndue to the fact that most of the novels are political is a question\\r\\nrather to be hinted than to be discussed. But the present writer has\\r\\nnever read a political novel, whether on his own side or on others, that\\r\\nseemed to him to be wholly satisfactory.\\nBulwer—for it is perhaps here not impolite or improper still to call\\r\\nthe first Lord Lytton by the name under which he wrote for forty years,\\r\\nand solidly niched himself in the novel-front of the minster of English\\r\\nLiterature—had not a few points of resemblance to his rival and future\\r\\nchief. But their relations to politics and letters were reversed.\\r\\nDisraeli was a born politician who was also a very considerable man of\\r\\nletters: Bulwer was a born man of letters who was a by no means\\r\\ninconsiderable politician. His literary ability was extraordinarily\\r\\ndiversified: but, once more, he was (here also) a born novelist, who was\\r\\nalso a not inconsiderable dramatist; a critic who might not impossibly\\r\\nhave been great, a miscellanist of ability, and a verse-writer than whom\\r\\nmany a worse has somehow or other obtained the name of poet. He began\\r\\nnovel-writing very early (Falkland is of 1827), he continued it all\\r\\nhis life, and he was the very Proteus-chameleon of the novel in changing\\r\\nhis styles to suit the tastes of the day. He never exactly copied\\r\\nanybody: and in all his various attempts he went extremely near to the\\r\\nconstruction of masterpieces. In the novel of society with Pelham\\r\\n(1828); the novel of crime with Eugene Aram (1832) and Zanoni\\r\\n(1842); the novel of passion and a sort of mystery with Ernest\\r\\nMaltravers and Alice; the historic romance with The Last Days of\\r\\nPompeii (1834), The Last of the Barons (1843), and Harold (1848),\\r\\nhe made marks deep and early. When the purely domestic kind came in he\\r\\nmade them, earlier and deeper still, with The Caxtons (1850), My\\r\\nNovel (1853), etc. He caught the \"sensation\" ball at nearly its first\\r\\nservice with his old \"mystery\" racket, and played the most brilliant\\r\\ngame of the whole tournament in A Strange Story (1862). At the last he\\r\\ntried later kinds still in books like The Coming Race (1871), The\\r\\nParisians (1873), and Kenelm Chillingly. And once, Pallas being kind,\\r\\nhe did an almost perfect thing (there is not a speck or a flaw in it\\r\\nexcept, perhaps, the mechanical death of the bulldog) and produced one\\r\\nof the best examples of one of the best and oldest classes of fiction\\r\\nknown to the world, in the ghost-story of The Haunted and the Haunters\\r\\n(1859).\\nSuch a mass, such a length, such a variety of production, with so many\\r\\nmerits in it, would be difficult to meet elsewhere in our department.\\r\\nAnd yet very few critics of unquestionable competence, if any, have\\r\\naccorded the absolute First Class to Lord Lytton as a novelist. That\\r\\nthis is partly (and rather unjustly) due to the singular and sometimes\\r\\npositively ridiculous grandiloquence and to the half-mawkish,\\r\\nhalf-rancid, sentimentality which too often mar his earlier novels is\\r\\nprobably true. But it is not all the truth: if it were, it would be\\r\\nalmost sufficient to point out that he outgrew the first of these faults\\r\\ncompletely, the second almost completely; and that from The Caxtons\\r\\n(1850) onward there is hardly any stain on his literary character in\\r\\nany such respect. But other faults—or at least defects—remain. They\\r\\nmay be almost summed up in the charge of want of consummateness.\\r\\nBulwer could be romantic—but his romance had the touch of bad taste and\\r\\ninsincerity referred to above. He could, as in The Caxtons, be fairly\\r\\ntrue to ordinary life—but even then he seemed to feel a necessity of\\r\\nsetting off and as it were apologising for the simplicity and veracity\\r\\nby touches—in fact by douches—of Sternian fantastry, and by other\\r\\ntouches of what was a little later to be called sensationalism. Even his\\r\\nhandling of the supernatural, which was undoubtedly a strong point of\\r\\nhis, was not wholly de ban aloi. To pronounce him, as was once done by\\r\\nan acute and amiable judge, \"the hummiest of bugs\" was excessive in\\r\\nlife, and would be preposterous in literature. But there undoubtedly\\r\\nwas, with rare exceptions, a suspicion of what is called in slang\\r\\n\"faking\" about his work. The wine is not \"neat\" but doctored; the\\r\\ncomposition is pastiche; a dozen other metaphors—of stucco, veneer,\\r\\nglueing-up—suggest themselves. And then there suggests itself, in turn,\\r\\na sort of shame at such imputations on the author of such a mass of\\r\\nwork, so various, so interesting, so important as accomplishment,\\r\\nsymptom, and pattern at once. And perhaps one may end by pronouncing\\r\\nBulwer one of the very greatest of English novelists who are not of the\\r\\nvery greatest.\\nIt is difficult to say whether the usual attitude of criticism to\\r\\nCaptain Marryat (1792-1848) is more uncritical than ungrateful or more\\r\\nungrateful than uncritical. Because he has amused the boy, it seems to\\r\\nbe taken for granted that he ought not to amuse the man: because he does\\r\\nnot write with the artificial and often extremely arbitrary graces of\\r\\nthe composition books, that he is \"not literature.\" If it be so, why in\\r\\nthe first case so much the worse for \"the man,\" and in the second so\\r\\nmuch the worse for literature. As a matter of fact, he has many of the\\r\\nqualities of the novelist in a high degree: and if he were in the\\r\\nfortunate position of an ancient classic, whose best works only survive,\\r\\nthese qualities could not fail of recognition. Much of his later work\\r\\nsimply ought not to count; for it was mere hack-labour, rendered, if not\\r\\nnecessary, very nearly so by the sailor\\'s habit (which Marryat possessed\\r\\nin the highest degree) of getting rid of money. Even among this,\\r\\nMasterman Ready and The Children of the New Forest, \"children\\'s\\r\\nbooks,\" as they may be called, rank very high in their kind. But he\\r\\ncounts here, of course, for his sea-novels mainly: and in them there are\\r\\nseveral things for us to notice. One is that Marryat had the true\\r\\nquality of the craftsman, as distinguished from the amateur or the\\r\\nchance-medley man who has a lucky inspiration. If it were the case that\\r\\nhis books derived their whole attraction from the novelty and (within\\r\\nits limits) the variety of their sea-matter, then the first ought to be\\r\\nthe best, as in nearly all such cases is the fact. But Frank Mildmay\\r\\n(1829), so far from being the best, is not far from being the worst of\\r\\nMarryat\\'s novels. Much—dangerously much—as he put of his own\\r\\nexperiences in the book, he did not know in the least how to manage\\r\\nthem. And if Frank is something of a bravo, more of a blackguard, and\\r\\nnearly a complete ruffian, it is not merely because there was a good\\r\\ndeal of brutality in the old navy; not merely because Marryat\\'s own\\r\\nstandard of chivalry was not quite that of Chaucer\\'s Knight:—but\\r\\npartly, also, because he was aiming blunderingly at what he supposed to\\r\\nbe part of the novelist\\'s business—irregular as well as regular\\r\\ngallantry, and highly seasoned adventure. But, like all good artists\\r\\n(and like hardly anybody who has not the artistic quality in him), he\\r\\ntaught himself by his failure, even though he sometimes relapsed. Of\\r\\nactual construction he was never a master. The King\\'s Own, with its\\r\\noverdose of history at the beginning and of melodrama at the end, is an\\r\\nexample. But his two masterpieces, Peter Simple (1834) and Mr.\\r\\nMidshipman Easy (1836), are capital instances of what may be called\\r\\n\"particularist\" fiction—the fiction that derives its special zest from\\r\\nthe \"colours\" of some form of life unfamiliar to those who have not\\r\\nactually lived it. Even Peter Simple is unduly weighted at the end by\\r\\nthe machinations of Peter\\'s uncle against him and, at intervals during\\r\\nthe book, by the proceedings connected therewith. But Mr. Midshipman\\r\\nEasy is flawless—except for the amiable but surely excessive\\r\\nsentimentalists who are shocked at the way in which Mr. Easy père\\r\\nquits the greater stage by mounting the lesser. Than this book there is\\r\\nnot a better novel of special \"humour\" in literature; as much may be\\r\\nsaid of the greater part of Peter Simple, of not a little in Jacob\\r\\nFaithful (a great favourite with Thackeray, who always did justice to\\r\\nMarryat), and Japhet in Search of a Father, and of something in almost\\r\\nall. Nor were high jinks and special naval matters by any means\\r\\nMarryat\\'s only province. Laymen may agree with experts in thinking the\\r\\nclubhauling of the Diomède in Peter Simple, and the two great fights\\r\\nof the Aurora with the elements and with the Russian frigate in Mr.\\r\\nMidshipman Easy, to be extraordinarily fine things:—vivid, free from\\r\\nextravagance, striking, stirring, clear, as descriptive and narrative\\r\\nliterature of the kind can be only at its best, and too seldom is at\\r\\nall. An almost Defoe-like exactness of detail is one of Marryat\\'s\\r\\nmethods and merits: while it is very remarkable that he rarely attempts\\r\\nto produce the fun, in which Defoe is lacking and he himself so\\r\\nfertile, by mere exaggeration or caricature of detail. There are\\r\\nexceptions—the Dominie business in Jacob Faithful is one—but they\\r\\nare exceptions. Take Hook, his immediate predecessor, and no doubt in a\\r\\nway his model, as (it has been said) Hook was to almost everybody at the\\r\\ntime; take even Dickens, his fellow-pupil with Hook and his own greater\\r\\nsuccessor; and you will find that Marryat resorts less than either to\\r\\nthe humour of simple charge or exaggeration.\\nThe last name on our present list belongs to the class of \"eccentric\"\\r\\nnovelists—the adjective being used, not in its transferred and partly\\r\\nimproper sense so much as in its true one. Peacock never plays the\\r\\nJack-pudding like Sterne: and his shrewd wit never permits him the\\r\\nsincere aberrations of Amory. But his work is out of the ordinary\\r\\ncourses, and does not turn round the ordinary centres of novel writing.\\r\\nIt belongs to the tradition—if to any tradition at all—of Lucian and\\r\\nthe Lucianists—especially as that tradition was redirected by Anthony\\r\\nHamilton. It thus comes, in one way, near part of the work of Disraeli;\\r\\nthough, except in point of satiric temper, its spirit is totally\\r\\ndifferent. Peacock was essentially a scholar (though a non-academic one)\\r\\nand essentially a humorist. In the progress of his books from Headlong\\r\\nHall (1816) to Gryll Grange (1860)—the last separated from the group\\r\\nto which the first belongs by more than twice as many years as were\\r\\ncovered by that group itself—he mellowed his tone, but altered his\\r\\nscheme very little. Except in Maid Marian and The Misfortunes of\\r\\nElphin, where the Scott influence is evident, though Peacock was\\r\\nhimself a rebel to Scott, the plan is always the same. Headlong Hall\\r\\nand Nightmare Abbey, Melincourt and Crotchet Castle (1831), as well\\r\\nas Gryll Grange itself, all have the uniform, though by no means\\r\\nmonotonous, canvas of a party of guests assembled at a country-house and\\r\\nconsisting of a number of \"originals,\" with one or more common-sense but\\r\\nby no means commonplace characters to serve as contrast. It is in the\\r\\nselection and management of these foils that one of Peacock\\'s principal\\r\\ndistinctions lies. In his earlier books, and in accordance with the\\r\\nmanners of the time, there is a good deal of \"high jinks\"—less later.\\r\\nIn all, there is also a good deal of personal and literary satire, which\\r\\ntones and mellows as it proceeds. At first Peacock is extremely unjust\\r\\nto the Lake poets—so unjust indeed as to be sometimes hardly\\r\\namusing—to the two universities (of which it so happened that he was\\r\\nnot a member), to the Tory party generally, to clergymen, to other\\r\\nthings and persons. In Crotchet Castle the progress of Reform was\\r\\nalready beginning to produce a beneficent effect of reaction upon him,\\r\\nand in Gryll Grange, though the manners and cast are surprisingly\\r\\nmodern, the whole tone is conservative—with a small if not even with a\\r\\nlarge C—for the most prominent and well treated character is a\\r\\nChurchman of the best academic Tory type.\\nIt is not, however, in anything yet mentioned that Peacock\\'s charm\\r\\nconsists, so much as in the intensely literary, but not in the least\\r\\npedantic, tone with which he suffuses his books, the piquant but not in\\r\\nthe least affected turn of the phrases that meet us throughout, the\\r\\npeculiar quality of his irony (most quintessenced in The Misfortunes of\\r\\nElphin, which is different in scheme from the rest, but omnipresent),\\r\\nand the crisp presentation of individual scene, incident, and character\\r\\nof a kind. Story, in the general sense, there is none, or next to\\r\\nnone—the personages meet, go through a certain number of dinners\\r\\n(Peacock is great at eating and drinking), diversions, and\\r\\ndifficulties, marry to a greater or less extent, but otherwise part. Yet\\r\\nsuch things as the character of Scythrop in Nightmare Abbey (a half\\r\\nfantastic, half faithful portrait of Shelley, who was Peacock\\'s intimate\\r\\nfriend), or of Dr. Folliott (a genial parson) in Crotchet Castle—as\\r\\nthe brilliant picture of the breaking of the dyke in Elphin, or the\\r\\ncomic one of the rotten-borough election in Melincourt—are among the\\r\\ntriumphs of the English novel. And they are present by dozens and\\r\\nscores: while (though it is a little out of our way) there is no doubt\\r\\nthat the attraction of the books is greatly enhanced by the abundance of\\r\\ninset verse—sometimes serious, more often light—of which Peacock,\\r\\nagain in an eccentric fashion, was hardly less a master than he was of\\r\\nprose.\\nHere also it has seemed fit to dwell on a single writer, not perhaps\\r\\ngenerally held to be of the absolutely first class, because these\\r\\n\"eccentrics\" are of very great importance in the history of the English\\r\\nnovel. The danger of the kind—even more than of other literary\\r\\nkinds—lies in the direction of mould and mechanism—of the production,\\r\\nby the thousand, of things of no individual quality and character. This\\r\\ndanger has been and is being amply exemplified. But the Peacocks (would\\r\\nthe plural were more justified!) save us from it by their own\\r\\nunconquerable individuality in the first place and, in the second, by\\r\\nthe fact that even the best in this kind is \"caviare to the general,\"\\r\\nwhile anything that is not the best has no attraction either for the\\r\\ngeneral or the elect. They are, as it were, the salt of the novel-feast,\\r\\nin more senses than one: and it is cause for thankfulness that, in this\\r\\nrespect as in the physical, England has been well off for salt-pits.\\nBesides these individual names—which in most literatures would be\\r\\ngreat, and even in English literature are not small—the second quarter\\r\\nof the century added to the history of the novel an infinity of others\\r\\nwho can hardly appear here even on the representative or selective\\r\\nsystem. All the suns of the novel hitherto mentioned had moons and stars\\r\\naround them; all the cadres of the various kinds were filled with\\r\\nprivates and non-commissioned officers to follow the leaders. Gait and\\r\\nMoir carried out the \"Scotch novel\" with something of Scott, but more of\\r\\nSmollett (Gait at least certainly, in part of his work, preceded Scott).\\r\\nLady Morgan, who has been mentioned already, Banim, Crofton Croker, and\\r\\nothers played a similar part to Miss Edgeworth. Glascock, Chamier, and\\r\\nHoward were, as it were, lieutenants (the last directly so) to Marryat.\\r\\nThe didactic side of Miss Edgeworth was taken up by Harriet Martineau.\\r\\nMrs. Shelley\\'s Frankenstein (1818) is among the latest good examples\\r\\nof the \"Terror\" class, to which her husband had contributed two of its\\r\\nworst, and two of the feeblest books ever written by a man of the\\r\\ngreatest genius, in Zastrozzi and St. Irvyne, some seven years\\r\\nearlier. Many women, not unnaturally, encouraged by the great examples\\r\\nof Miss Burney, Miss Edgeworth, Miss Austen, and Miss Ferrier, attempted\\r\\nnovels of the most various kinds, sometimes almost achieving the purely\\r\\ndomestic variety, sometimes branching to other sorts. The novels of Mrs.\\r\\nGore, chiefly in the \"fashionable\" kind, are said to have attained the\\r\\nthree-score and ten in number; Mrs. Crowe dealt with the supernatural\\r\\noutside of her novels if not also in them; the luckless poetess \"L.E.L.\"\\r\\nwas a novelist in Ethel Churchill (1837) and other books; Mrs.\\r\\nTrollope, prolific mother of a more prolific son, showed not a little\\r\\npower, if not quite so much taste, in The Vicar of Wrexhill (1837) and\\r\\nThe Widow Barnaby. Single books, like Morier\\'s Hajji Baba (1824),\\r\\nHope\\'s Anastasius (1819), Croly\\'s Salathiel (1829), gained fame\\r\\nwhich they have not quite lost: and the little known Michael Scott\\r\\n(1789-1835) left in Tom Cringle\\'s Log and The Cruise of the Midge a\\r\\npair of stories of West Indian scenery and adventure which are nearly\\r\\nfirst rate. In 1839, not long after Pickwick, Samuel Warren\\'s Ten\\r\\nThousand a Year blended Bulwer and Dickens in a manner which to this\\r\\nday is a puzzle in its near approach to success. Yet he never repeated\\r\\nthis approach, though he had earlier done striking things in the Diary\\r\\nof a Late Physician (1830). But in the latest thirties and early\\r\\nforties there arose two writers who were to eclipse every one of their\\r\\ncontemporaries in this kind.\\nThe remarkable originality and idiosyncrasy of Dickens have perhaps, to\\r\\nsome extent and from not a few persons, concealed the fact that he was\\r\\nnot, any more than other people, an earth-born wonder. Scanted of\\r\\neducation as he was, he has in several places frankly and eagerly\\r\\nconfessed his early acquaintance with the great older novelists, and his\\r\\nspecial fancy for Smollett—whose influence indeed is traceable on him\\r\\nfrom first to last, and not least in the famous \"interiors\" of which he\\r\\nmade far more than his example had done. Even in Pickwick the expert\\r\\nwill trace suggestions from others. But if the work is read in its\\r\\nproper order, and the Sketches by Boz are taken first, nobody who\\r\\nknows both Leigh Hunt and Theodore Hook will fail to see that Dickens\\r\\nowed a great deal to both. The fact is in no sense discreditable to him:\\r\\non the contrary, it adds, in the estimation of all reasonable and\\r\\ncritical judges, a very great deal of interest, and takes away none. The\\r\\nearth-born prodigy is seldom good for much and never for very much. The\\r\\ngenius who fastens on the points in preceding literature most congenial\\r\\nto him, develops them, builds on them with his own matter and form, and\\r\\nturns out something far greater than his originals is the really\\r\\nsatisfactory person. Had Leigh Hunt lent to Hook his literature, his\\r\\nfund of trivial but agreeable observation and illustration, and his\\r\\nattractive style; had Hook communicated to Hunt his narrative faculty\\r\\nand his fecundity in character and manners:—neither could have written\\r\\nPickwick or even the worst of its successors. Had there been no Hunt\\r\\nand no Hook, Dickens would no doubt have managed, in some fashion, to\\r\\n\"do for himself.\" But it would have given him more trouble, he would\\r\\nhave done it more slowly, and he would hardly have earned that generous\\r\\nand admirable phrase of his greatest contemporary in fiction which will\\r\\nbe quoted shortly.\\nNeither from Smollett, however, nor from Hook, nor from Hunt, nor from\\r\\nanybody else did Dickens take what makes him Dickens. His idiosyncrasy,\\r\\nalready mentioned, is so marked that everybody acknowledges its\\r\\npresence: but its exact character and nature are matter not so much of\\r\\ndebate (though they are that also in the highest degree) as matter of\\r\\nmore or less questing, often of a rather blind-man\\'s-buff kind. There\\r\\nis probably no author of whom really critical estimates are so rare. He\\r\\nhas given so much pleasure to so many people—perhaps there are none to\\r\\nwhom he has given more pleasure than to some of those who have\\r\\ncriticised him most closely—that to mention any faults in him is\\r\\nupbraided as a sort of personal and detestable ingratitude and\\r\\ntreachery. If you say that he cannot draw a gentleman, you are told that\\r\\nyou are a parrot and a snob, who repeats what other snobs have told you;\\r\\nthat gentlemen are not worth drawing; that he can draw them; and so\\r\\nforth. If you suggest that he is fantastic, it is reproachfully asked if\\r\\npoetry is not fantastic, and if you do not like poetry? If you intimate\\r\\nsmall affection for Little Nell and Little Paul, you are a brute; if you\\r\\nhint that his social crusades were often quite irrational, and sometimes\\r\\nat least as mischievous as they were beneficial, you are a parasite of\\r\\naristocracy and a foe of \"the people.\" If you take exception to his\\r\\nrepetitions, his mannerisms, his tedious catch-processes of various\\r\\nkinds, you are a \"stop-watch critic\" and worthy of all the generous\\r\\nwrath of the exemplary and Reverend Mr. Yorick. And yet all these\\r\\nassertions, objections, descriptions, are arch-true: and they can be\\r\\nmade by persons who know Dickens and enjoy Dickens a thousand times\\r\\nbetter—who admire him in a manner a thousand times more really\\r\\ncomplimentary—than the folk who simply cry \"Great is Dickens\" and will\\r\\nlisten to nothing but their own sweet voices.\\nThe real, the great, the unique merit of Dickens is that he brought to\\r\\nthe service of the novel an imagination which, though it was never\\r\\npoetic, was plastic in almost the highest degree: and that he\\r\\ncommunicated to the results of it a kind of existence which, though\\r\\ndistinctly different from that of actual life, has a reality of its own,\\r\\nand possesses the distinguishing mark of genius, so that if it does not\\r\\nexactly force belief in itself, it forces suspension of disbelief. To\\r\\nhave done this is not only to have accomplished a wonderful artistic\\r\\ntriumph, but to confer an immense benefit on the human race. But in\\r\\ndoing it Dickens exhibits various foibles, prejudices, and disabilities:\\r\\nthough it is quite open to any one to maintain that these rather\\r\\nassisted the flow of his imagination than hindered it. He began very\\r\\nyoung; he had curiously little literature; his knowledge of life,\\r\\nextraordinarily alert and acute, was very one-sided, and the organs by\\r\\nwhich he attained it seem absolutely to shut themselves and refuse\\r\\ncommunion with certain orders of society and classes of human creatures.\\r\\nThe wealth of fantastic imagery which he used to such purpose not\\r\\ninfrequently stimulated him to a disorderly profusion of grotesque; he\\r\\nwas congenitally melodramatic; and before very long his habit of\\r\\nattributing special catch-words, gestures, and the like to his\\r\\ncharacters, exaggerated, degenerated, and stereotyped itself in a\\r\\nfashion which it is difficult to think satisfactory to anybody. He was,\\r\\nmoreover, a \"novelist of purpose\" in the highest degree; he had very\\r\\nstrong, but very crude—not to say absurd—political ideas; and he was\\r\\napt to let the great powers of pathos, of humour, of vivid description,\\r\\nwhich he possessed to \"get out of hand\" and to land him in the maudlin,\\r\\nthe extravagant, and the bombastic.\\nBut—to put ourselves in connection with the main thread of our story\\r\\nonce more—he not only himself provided a great amount of the novel\\r\\npleasure for his readers, but he infused into the novel generally\\r\\nsomething of a new spirit. It has been more than once pointed out that\\r\\nthere is almost more danger with the novel of \"getting into ruts\" than\\r\\nwith any kind of literature. Nobody could charge the Dickens novel with\\r\\ndoing this, except as regards mannerisms of style, and though it might\\r\\ninspire many, it was very unlikely to create a rut for any one else. He\\r\\nliked to call himself \"the inimitable,\" and so, in a way, he was.\\r\\nImitations of him were, of course, tried: but they were all bad and\\r\\nobvious failures. Against the possible tameness of the domestic novel;\\r\\nagainst the too commonly actual want of actuality of the historic\\r\\nromance; he set this new fantastic activity of his, which was at once\\r\\nreal and unreal, but where the reality had a magical touch of the\\r\\nunfamiliar and the very unreality was stimulating. He might have a\\r\\nhundred faults—he was in fact never faultless, except in Pickwick,\\r\\nwhich is so absolutely unique that there is nothing to compare with it\\r\\nand show up faults (if it has any) by the comparison. But you can read\\r\\nhim again and again with unceasing delight, and with delight of a kind\\r\\ngiven by no other novelist.21\\nThe position of Thackeray in the history of the novel is as different\\r\\nfrom that of Dickens as the fortunes of the two were in their own\\r\\nprogress and development. In fact, though a sort of pseudo-Plutarchian\\r\\nparallel between them is nearly as inevitable as it is common, it is a\\r\\nparallel almost entirely composed of differences, carried out in matter\\r\\nalmost incommensurable. In the first place, Dickens, as we have seen,\\r\\nand as Thackeray said (with the generous and characteristic addition \"at\\r\\nthe head of the whole tribe\"), \"came and took his place calmly\" and\\r\\npractically at once (or with the preliminary only of \"Boz\") in\\r\\nPickwick. Whether he ever went further may at least be questioned. But\\r\\nThackeray did not take his place at once—in fact he conspicuously\\r\\nfailed to take it for some sixteen years: although he produced, for at\\r\\nleast the last ten of these, work containing indications of\\r\\nextraordinary power, in a variety of directions almost as extraordinary.\\nTo attempt to assign reasons for this comparative failure would be\\r\\nidle—the fact is the only reasonable reason. But some phenomena and\\r\\nsymptoms can be diagnosed. It is at least noteworthy that Thackeray—in\\r\\nthis approaching Dickens perhaps nearer than in any other point—began\\r\\nwith extravaganza—to adopt perhaps the most convenient general name\\r\\nfor a thing which cannot be quite satisfactorily designated by any. In\\r\\nboth cases the adoption was probably due to the example and popularity\\r\\nof Theodore Hook. But it was also due, in a higher and more metaphysical\\r\\nsense, to the fact that the romance, which had had so mighty a success\\r\\nin Scott\\'s hands, was for the time overblown, and that the domestic\\r\\nnovel, despite the almost equally wonderful, though much quieter and\\r\\nless popular achievement of Miss Austen, was not thoroughly and\\r\\ngenuinely ready. From extravaganza in a certain sense Dickens, as has\\r\\nbeen said, never really departed: and he achieved most of his best work\\r\\nin his own peculiar varieties of it. Thackeray was, if not to leave it\\r\\nentirely aside, to use it in his later days merely as an occasional\\r\\nvariation and seasoning. But at first he could not, apparently, get free\\r\\nfrom it: and he might have seemed unable to dispense with its almost\\r\\nmechanical externalities of mis-spelling and the like. It must also be\\r\\nremembered that circumstances were at first curiously unfavourable to\\r\\nhim: and that loss of fortune, domestic affliction, and other things\\r\\nalmost compelled him to write from hand to mouth—to take whatever\\r\\ncommission offered itself: whereas the, if not immediate, speedy and\\r\\ntremendous success of Pickwick put the booksellers entirely at\\r\\nDickens\\'s feet. Still, a certain vacillation—an uncertainty of design\\r\\nnot often accompanying genius like his—must be acknowledged in\\r\\nThackeray. For a time he hesitated between pen and pencil, the latter of\\r\\nwhich implements he fortunately never abandoned, though the former was\\r\\nhis predestined wand. Then he could not, or would not, for years, get\\r\\nout of the \"miscellaneous\" style, or patchwork of styles—reviews, short\\r\\nstories, burlesques, what not. His more important attempts seemed to\\r\\nhave an attendant guignon.22 Catherine (1839-1840), a very powerful\\r\\nthing in parts, was ill-planned and could not be popular. A Shabby\\r\\nGenteel Story (1841), containing almost the Thackerayan quiddity, was\\r\\ninterrupted partly by his wife\\'s illness, partly, it would seem, by\\r\\neditorial disfavour, and moreover still failed to shake off the\\r\\nappearance of a want of seriousness. Even The Great Hoggarty Diamond\\r\\n(1841-1842) was apparently cut short by request, and still lay open to\\r\\nan unjust, but not quite inexcusable, question on this same point of\\r\\n\"seriousness.\" In all there was, or might seem to be, a queer and to\\r\\nsome readers an unsatisfactory blend of what they had not learnt to call\\r\\n\"realism\" with what they were quite likely to think fooling. During\\r\\nthese years Thackeray was emphatically of the class of writers of whom\\r\\npeople \"do not know what to make.\" And it is a true saying of English\\r\\npeople—though perhaps not so pre-eminently true of them as some would\\r\\nhave it—that \"not to know what to make\" of a thing or a person is\\r\\nsufficient reason for them to distrust, dislike, and \"wash their hands\\r\\nof\" it or him.\\nSome would have it that Barry Lyndon (1843) marks the close of this\\r\\nperiod of indecision and the beginning of that of maturity. The commoner\\r\\nand perhaps the juster opinion is that this position belongs to Vanity\\r\\nFair (1846-1848). At any rate, after that book there could be no\\r\\ndoubt about the fact of the greatness of its writer, though it may be\\r\\ndoubted whether even now the quality of this greatness is correctly and\\r\\ngenerally recognised. It is this—that at last the novel of real life on\\r\\nthe great scale has been discovered. Even yet a remnant of shyness hangs\\r\\non the artist. He puts his scene a little though not very far back; he\\r\\nborrows a little, though not much, historical and romantic interest in\\r\\nthe Waterloo part; the catastrophe of the Becky-Steyne business, though\\r\\nby no means outside of the probable contents of any day\\'s newspaper, is\\r\\nslightly exceptional. But on the whole the problem of \"reality, the\\r\\nwhole reality, and nothing but reality\" is faced and grasped and\\r\\nsolved—with, of course, the addition to the \"nothing but\" of \"except\\r\\nart.\"\\nHe had struck his path and he kept to it: even when, as in Esmond\\r\\n(1852) and The Virginians (1858-1859) actually, and in Denis Duval\\r\\nprospectively, he blended the historical with the domestic variety.\\r\\nPendennis (1849-1850) imports nothing out of the most ordinary\\r\\nexperience; The Newcomes (1854-1855) very little; Philip (1861-1862)\\r\\nonly its pantomime conclusion; while the two completely historical tales\\r\\nare in nothing more remarkable than in the way in which their remoter\\r\\nand more unfamiliar main subject, and their occasional excursions from\\r\\neveryday life, are subdued to the scheme of the realist novel in the\\r\\nbest sense of the term—the novel rebuilt and refashioned on the lines\\r\\nof Fielding, but with modern manners, relying on variety and life, and\\r\\nrelying on these only.\\nThere is thus something of similarity (though with attendant\\r\\ndifferences, of the most important kind) between the joint position of\\r\\nDickens and Thackeray towards the world of the novel, and the joint\\r\\nposition of Scott and Miss Austen. They overlap more than their great\\r\\nforerunners of the preceding generation. Both wrote historical novels:\\r\\nit is indeed Thackeray\\'s unique distinction that he was equally master\\r\\nof the historical novel and of the novel of pure modern society, almost\\r\\nuneventful. In parts of some of his later books, especially Little\\r\\nDorrit, Great Expectations, and Our Mutual Friend, Dickens at\\r\\nleast tried to exchange his picaresque-fantastic cloudland for actual\\r\\nordinary modern life. But on the whole the method of Thackeray was the\\r\\nmethod of the novel, though shot with a strong romantic spirit, and the\\r\\nmethod of Dickens the method of the romance applied, for the most part,\\r\\nto material which could hardly be called romantic. Both, therefore, in a\\r\\nmanner, recalled the forces of fiction from the rather straggling and\\r\\nparticularist courses which it had been pursuing for the last quarter of\\r\\na century.\\nIn fact, even in the two mighty men of genius whom we have just been\\r\\ndiscussing, there may be seen—at their beginnings at least—something\\r\\nof that irresolution, uncertainty, and want of reliance on the powers of\\r\\nthe novel, it-by-itself-it, which we have noticed before: and which the\\r\\nunerring craftsmanship of Scott had already pointed out in the\\r\\n\"Conversation of the Author of Waverley with Captain Clutterbuck\" more\\r\\nthan once referred to. They want excuses and pretexts, bladders and\\r\\nspring-boards. Even Dickens, despite his irrepressible self-reliance,\\r\\nburdens himself, at the beginning of Pickwick, with the clumsy old\\r\\nmachinery of a club which he practically drops: and, still later, with\\r\\nthe still more clumsy framework of \"Master Humphrey\\'s Clock\" which he\\r\\nhas not quietly to drop, but openly to strip off and cast away, before\\r\\nhe has gone very far. Thackeray takes sixteen years of experiment before\\r\\nhe trusts his genius, boldly and on the great scale, to reveal itself in\\r\\nits own way, and in the straight way of the novel.\\nYet in this time also a great advance was made, as is shown not only by\\r\\nthe fact that Dickens and Thackeray themselves became possible, but by\\r\\nthe various achievements of the principal writers mentioned in this\\r\\nchapter, of one or two who might have been, but are perhaps, on the\\r\\nwhole, best postponed to the next, such as Lever, and of the great army\\r\\nof minorities who have been of necessity omitted. In every direction and\\r\\nfrom every point of view novel is growing. Although it was abused by\\r\\nprecisians, the gran conquesta of Scott had forced it into general\\r\\nrecognition and requisition. Even the still severe discipline of family\\r\\nlife in the first half of the nineteenth century, instead of excluding\\r\\nit altogether, contented itself with prescribing that \"novels should not\\r\\nbe read in the morning.\" A test which may be thought vulgar by the\\r\\nsuper-fine or the superficial, but a pretty good one, is the altered\\r\\nstatus and position of the writers of novels. In the eighteenth,\\r\\nespecially the earlier eighteenth, century the novelist had not merely\\r\\nbeen looked down upon as a novelist, but had, as a rule, resorted to\\r\\nnovel-writing under some stress of circumstance. Even when he was by\\r\\nbirth a \"gentleman of coat armour\" as Fielding and Smollett were, he was\\r\\nusually a gentleman very much out at elbows: the stories, true or false,\\r\\nof Rasselas and Johnson\\'s mother\\'s funeral expenses, of the Vicar of\\r\\nWakefield and Goldsmith\\'s dunning landlady, have something more than\\r\\nmere anecdote in them. Mackenzie, though the paternity of his famille\\r\\ndéplorable of novels was no secret, preserved a strict nominal\\r\\nincognito. Women, as having no regular professions and plenty of time at\\r\\ntheir disposal, were allowed more latitude: and this really perhaps had\\r\\nsomething to do with their early prominence in the novel; but it is\\r\\ncertain that Scott\\'s rigid, and for a long time successful, maintenance\\r\\nof the mask was by no means mere prudery, and still less merely prudent\\r\\ncommercial speculation. Yet he, who altered so much in the novel,\\r\\naltered this also. Of the novelists noticed in the early part of this\\r\\nchapter, one became Prime Minister of England, another rose to cabinet\\r\\nrank, a baronetcy, and a peerage; a third was H.M. consul in important\\r\\nposts abroad; a fourth held a great position, if not in the service\\r\\ndirectly of the crown, in what was of hardly less importance, that of\\r\\nthe East India Company; a fifth was a post-captain in the navy and\\r\\nCompanion of the Bath.\\nAnd all this had been rendered possible partly by the genius of\\r\\nnovel-writers, partly by the appetite of the novel-reader. This latter\\r\\nwas to continue unabated: whether the former was to increase, to\\r\\nmaintain itself, or slacken must be, to some extent of course, matter of\\r\\nopinion. But we have still two quarter-centuries to survey, in the first\\r\\nof which there may perhaps be some reason for thinking that the novel\\r\\nrose to its actual zenith. Nearly all the writers mentioned in this\\r\\nchapter continued to write—the greater part, in genius, of Thackeray\\'s\\r\\naccomplished work, and the greater part, in bulk, of Dickens\\'s, had\\r\\nstill to appear. But these elders were reinforced by fresh recruits,\\r\\nsome of them of a prowess only inferior to the very greatest: and a\\r\\ndistinct development of the novel itself, in the direction of\\r\\nself-reliance and craftsmanlike working on its own lines, was to be\\r\\nseen. In particular, the deferred influence of Miss Austen was at last\\r\\nto be brought to bear with astonishing results: while, partly owing to\\r\\nthe example of Thackeray, the historical variety (which had for the most\\r\\npart been a pale and rather vulgarised imitation of Scott), was to be\\r\\nrevived and varied in a manner equally astonishing. More than ever we\\r\\nshall have to let styles and kinds \"speak by their foremen\"—in fact to\\r\\nsome extent to let them speak for themselves with very little detailed\\r\\nnotice even of these foremen. But we shall still endeavour to keep the\\r\\ngeneral threads in hand and to exhibit their direction, their crossing,\\r\\nand their other phenomena, as clearly as possible to the reader. For\\r\\nonly so can we complete the picture of the course of fiction throughout\\r\\nEnglish literature—with the sole exclusion of living writers, whose\\r\\nwork can never be satisfactorily treated in such a book as this—first,\\r\\nbecause they are living and, secondly, because it is not done.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\nTHE MID-VICTORIAN NOVEL\\nAt about the very middle of the nineteenth century—say from 1845 to\\r\\n1855 in each direction, but almost increasingly towards the actual\\r\\ndividing line of 1850—there came upon the English novel a very\\r\\nremarkable wind of refreshment and new endeavour. Thackeray and Dickens\\r\\nthemselves are examples of it, with Lever and others, before this\\r\\ndividing line: many others yet come to join them. A list of books\\r\\nwritten out just as they occur to the memory, and without any attempt to\\r\\nmarshal them in strict chronological order, would show this beyond all\\r\\nreasonable possibility of gainsaying. Thackeray\\'s own best accomplished\\r\\nwork from Vanity Fair (1846) itself through Pendennis (1849) and\\r\\nEsmond (1852) to The Newcomes (1854); the brilliant centre of\\r\\nDickens\\'s work in David Copperfield (1850)—stand at the head and have\\r\\nbeen already noticed by anticipation or implication, while Lever had\\r\\nalmost completed the first division of his work, which began with Harry\\r\\nLorrequer as early as the year of Pickwick. But such books as Yeast\\r\\n(1848), Westward Ho! (1855); as The Warden (1855); as Jane Eyre\\r\\n(1847) and its too few successors; as Scenes of Clerical Life (1857);\\r\\nas Mary Barton (1848) and the novels which followed it, with others\\r\\nwhich it is perhaps almost unfair to leave out even in this allusive\\r\\nsummary by sample, betokened a stirring of the waters, a rattling among\\r\\nthe bones, such as is not common in literature. Death removed Thackeray\\r\\nearly and Dickens somewhat less prematurely, but after a period rather\\r\\nbarren in direct novel work. The others continued and were constantly\\r\\nreinforced: nor was it till well on in the seventies that any distinct\\r\\ndrop from first- to second-growth quality could be observed in the\\r\\ngeneral vintage of English fiction.\\nOne is not quite driven, on this occasion, to the pusillanimous\\r\\nexplanation that this remarkable variety and number of good novels was\\r\\nsimply due to the simultaneous existence of an equally remarkable number\\r\\nof good novelists. The fact is that, by this time, the great example of\\r\\nScott and Miss Austen—the great wave of progress which exemplified\\r\\nitself first and most eminently in these two writers—had had time to\\r\\nwork upon and permeate another generation of practitioners. The\\r\\nnovelists who have just been cited were as a rule born in the second\\r\\ndecade of the century, just before, about, or after the time at which\\r\\nScott and Miss Austen began to publish. They had therefore—as their\\r\\nelders, even though they may have had time to read the pair, had\\r\\nnot—time to assimilate thoroughly and early the results which that pair\\r\\nhad produced or which they had first expressed. And they had even\\r\\ngreater advantages than this. They had had time to assimilate, likewise,\\r\\nthe results of all the rest of that great literary generation of which\\r\\nScott and Miss Austen were themselves but members. They profited by\\r\\nthirty years more of constant historical exploration and realising of\\r\\nformer days. One need not say, for it is question-begging, that they\\r\\nalso profited by, but they could at least avail themselves of, the\\r\\nimmense change of manners and society which made 1850 differ more from\\r\\n1800 than 1800 had differed, not merely from 1750 but from 1700. They\\r\\nhad, even though all of them may not have been sufficiently grateful for\\r\\nit, the stimulus of that premier position in Europe which the country\\r\\nhad gained in the Napoleonic wars, and which she had not yet wholly lost\\r\\nor even begun to lose. They had wider travel, more extended occupations\\r\\nand interests, many other new things to draw upon. And, lastly, they had\\r\\nsome important special incidents and movements—the new arrangement of\\r\\npolitical parties, the Oxford awakening, and others—to give suggestion\\r\\nand impetus to novels of the specialist kind. Nay, they had not only the\\r\\ngreat writers, in other kinds, of the immediate past, but those of the\\r\\npresent, Carlyle, Tennyson, latterly Ruskin, and others still to\\r\\ncomplete their education and the machinery of its development.\\nThe most remarkable feature of this renouveau, as has been both\\r\\ndirectly and indirectly observed before, is the resumption, the immense\\r\\nextension, and the extraordinary improvement of the domestic novel. Not\\r\\nthat this had not been practised during the thirty years since Miss\\r\\nAusten\\'s death. But the external advantages just enumerated had failed\\r\\nit: and it had enlisted none of the chief talents which were at the\\r\\nservice of fiction generally. A little more gift and a good deal more\\r\\ntaste might have enabled Mrs. Trollope to do really great things in it:\\r\\nbut she left them for her son to accomplish. Attempts and \"tries\" at it\\r\\nhad been made constantly, and the goal had been very nearly reached,\\r\\nespecially, perhaps, in that now much forgotten but remarkable Emilia\\r\\nWyndham (1846) by Anne Caldwell (Mrs. Marsh), which was wickedly\\r\\ndescribed by a sister novelist as the \"book where the woman breaks her\\r\\ndesk open with her head,\" but which has real power and exercised real\\r\\ninfluence for no short time.\\nThis new domestic novel followed Miss Austen in that it did not\\r\\nnecessarily avail itself of anything but perfectly ordinary life, and\\r\\nrelied chiefly on artistic presentment—on treatment rather than on\\r\\nsubject. It departed from her in that it admitted a much wider range and\\r\\nvariety of subject itself; and by no means excluded the passions and\\r\\nemotions which, though she had not been so prudish as to ignore their\\r\\nresults, she had never chosen to represent in much actual exercise, or\\r\\nto make the mainsprings of her books.\\nThe first supreme work of the kind was perhaps in Vanity Fair and\\r\\nPendennis, the former admitting exceptional and irregular developments\\r\\nas an integral part of its plot and general appeal, the latter doing for\\r\\nthe most part without them. But Pendennis exhibited in itself, and\\r\\ntaught to other novelists, if not an absolutely new, a hitherto little\\r\\nworked, and clumsily worked, source of novel interest. We have seen how,\\r\\nas early as Head or Kirkman, the possibility of making such a source out\\r\\nof the ways of special trades, professions, employments, and vocations\\r\\nhad been partly seen and utilised. Defoe did it more; Smollett more\\r\\nstill; and since the great war there had been naval and military novels\\r\\nin abundance, as well as novels political, clerical, sporting, and what\\r\\nnot. But these special interests had been as a rule drawn upon too\\r\\nonesidedly. The eighteenth century found its mistaken fondness for\\r\\nepisodes, inset stories, and the like, particularly convenient here: the\\r\\nnaval, military, sporting, and other novels of the nineteenth were apt\\r\\nto rely too exclusively on these differences. Such things as the\\r\\nOxbridge scenes and the journalism scenes of Pendennis—both among the\\r\\nmost effective and popular, perhaps the most effective and popular,\\r\\nparts of the book—were almost, if not entirely, new. There had been\\r\\nbefore, and have since been, plenty of university novels, and their\\r\\nrecord has been a record of almost uninterrupted failure; there have\\r\\nsince, if not before, Pendennis been several \"press\" novels, and their\\r\\nrecord has certainly not been a record of unbroken success. But the\\r\\nemployment here, by genius, of such subjects for substantial parts of\\r\\na novel was a success pure and unmixed. So, in the earlier book, the\\r\\nsame author had shown how the most humdrum incident and the minutest\\r\\npainting of ordinary character could be combined with historic tragedy\\r\\nlike that furnished by Waterloo, with domestic drame of the most\\r\\nexciting kind like the discovery of Lord Steyne\\'s relations with Becky,\\r\\nor the at least suggested later crime of that ingenious and rather\\r\\nhardly treated little person.\\nMost of the writers mentioned and glanced at above took—not of course\\r\\nalways, often, or perhaps ever in conscious following of Thackeray, but\\r\\nin consequence of the same \"skiey influences\" which worked on him—to\\r\\nthis mixed domestic-dramatic line. And what is still more interesting,\\r\\nmen who had already made their mark for years, in styles quite\\r\\ndifferent, turned to it and adopted it. We have seen this of Bulwer, and\\r\\nthe evidences of the change in him which are given by the \"Caxton\"\\r\\nnovels. We have not yet directly dealt with another instance of almost\\r\\nas great interest and distinction, Charles Lever, though we have named\\r\\nhim and glanced at his work.\\nLever, who was born as early as 1806, had, it has been said, begun to\\r\\nwrite novels as early as his junior, Dickens, and had at once developed,\\r\\nin Harry Lorrequer, a pretty distinct style of his own. This style was\\r\\na kind of humour-novel with abundant incident, generally with a somewhat\\r\\n\"promiscuous\" plot and with lively but externally drawn characters—the\\r\\nhumours being furnished partly by Lever\\'s native country, Ireland, and\\r\\npartly by the traditions of the great war of which he had collected a\\r\\nstore in his capacity of physician to the Embassy at Brussels. He had\\r\\nkept up this style, the capital example of which is Charles O\\'Malley\\r\\n(1840), with unabated verve and with great popular success for a dozen\\r\\nyears before 1850. But about that time, or rather earlier, the general\\r\\n\"suck\" of the current towards a different kind (assisted no doubt by the\\r\\nfeeling that the public might be getting tired of the other style) made\\r\\nhim change it into studies of a less specialised kind—of foreign\\r\\ntravel, home life, and the like—sketches which, in his later days\\r\\nstill, he brought even closer to actuality. It is true that in the long\\r\\nrun his popularity has depended, and will probably always depend, on the\\r\\nearly \"rollicking\" adventure books: not only because of their natural\\r\\nappeal, but because there is plenty of the other thing elsewhere, and\\r\\nhardly any of this particular thing anywhere. To almost anybody, for\\r\\ninstance, except a very great milksop or a pedant of construction,\\r\\nCharles O\\'Malley with its love-making and its fighting, its\\r\\nhorsemanship and its horse-play, its \"devilled kidneys\"23 and its\\r\\ndevil-may-care-ness, is a distinctly delectable composition; and if a\\r\\nreasonable interval be allowed between the readings, may be read over\\r\\nand over again, at all times of life, with satisfaction. But the fact of\\r\\nthe author\\'s change remains not the less historically and\\r\\nsymptomatically important, in connection with the larger change of which\\r\\nwe are now taking notice, and with the similar phenomena observable in\\r\\nthe work of Bulwer. At the same time it has been pointed out that the\\r\\nfollowing of Miss Austen by no means excluded the following of Scott:\\r\\nand that the new development included \"crosses\" of novel and romance,\\r\\nsometimes of the historical kind, sometimes not, which are of the\\r\\nhighest, or all but the highest, interest. Early and good examples of\\r\\nthese may be found in the work of the Brontës, Charlotte and Emily (the\\r\\nthird sister Anne is but a pale reflection of her elders), and of\\r\\nCharles Kingsley. Charlotte (b. 1816) and Charles (b. 1819) were\\r\\nseparated in their birth by but three years, Emily (b. 1818) and\\r\\nKingsley by but one.\\nThe curious story of the struggles of the Brontë girls to get published\\r\\nhardly concerns us, and Emily\\'s work, Wuthering Heights,24 is one of\\r\\nthose isolated books which, whatever their merit, are rather ornaments\\r\\nthan essential parts in novel history. But this is not the case with\\r\\nJane Eyre (1847), Shirley (1849), Villette (1852), and The\\r\\nProfessor (1857) (but written much earlier). These are all examples of\\r\\nthe determination to base novels on actual life and experience. Few\\r\\nnovelists have ever kept so close to their own part in these as\\r\\nCharlotte Brontë did, though she accompanied, permeated, and to a\\r\\ncertain extent transformed her autobiography and observation by a\\r\\nstrong romantic and fantastic imaginative element. Deprive Thackeray and\\r\\nDickens of nearly all their humour and geniality, take a portion only of\\r\\nthe remaining genius of each in the ratio of about 2 Th. to 1 D.,\\r\\nadd a certain dash of the old terror-novel and the German fantastic\\r\\ntale, moisten with feminine spirit and water, and mix thoroughly: and\\r\\nyou have something very like Charlotte Brontë. But it is necessary to\\r\\nadd further, and it is her great glory, the perfume and atmosphere of\\r\\nthe Yorkshire moors, which she had in not quite such perfection as her\\r\\nsister Emily, but in combination with more general novel-gift. Her\\r\\nactual course of writing was short, and it could probably in no case\\r\\nhave been long; she wanted wider and, perhaps, happier experience, more\\r\\nliterature, more man-and-woman-of-the-worldliness, perhaps a sweeter and\\r\\nmore genial temper. But the English novel would have been incomplete\\r\\nwithout her and her sister; they are, as wholes, unlike anybody else,\\r\\nand if they are not exactly great they have the quality of greatness.\\r\\nAbove all, they kept novel and romance together—a deed which is great\\r\\nwithout any qualification or drawback.\\nCharles Kingsley is one of the most precious documents for the cynics\\r\\nwho say that while, if you please the public in only one way, you may\\r\\npossibly meet with only tolerable ingratitude; if you attempt to please\\r\\nit in more ways than one, you are certain to be suspected, and still\\r\\nmore certain to have the defects of your weakest work transferred to\\r\\nyour best. He was a novelist, a poet, an essayist, a preacher, a\\r\\nhistorian, and a critic. His history, though less positively inaccurate\\r\\nthan the \"dead set\" against him of certain notorious persons chose to\\r\\nrepresent it, was uncritical: and his criticism, sometimes acute and\\r\\nluminous, was decidedly unhistorical. But he was a preacher of\\r\\nremarkable merit, a charming and original essayist, a poet of no wide\\r\\nrange but of true poetical quality, and a novelist of great variety and\\r\\nof almost the first class. He let his weakest qualities go in with his\\r\\nstrongest in his novels, and had also the still more unfortunate\\r\\ntendency to \"trail coats\" of the most inconceivably different colours\\r\\nfor others to tread upon. Liberals, Radicals, and Tories; Roman\\r\\nCatholics, High Churchmen, Low Churchmen, and No-Churchmen;\\r\\nsentimentalists and cynics; people who do not like literary and\\r\\nhistorical allusion, and people who are meticulous about literary and\\r\\nhistorical accuracy—all these and many others, if they cannot disregard\\r\\nflings at their own particular tastes, fancies, and notions, are sure to\\r\\nlose patience with him now and then. Accordingly, he has met with some\\r\\nexacerbated decriers, and with very few thorough-going defenders.\\nYet almost thoroughing-going defence is, as far as the novels (our\\r\\nonly direct business) are concerned, far from difficult; and the present\\r\\nwriter, though there are perhaps not a dozen consecutive pages of\\r\\nKingsley\\'s novels to which, at some point or other, he is not prepared\\r\\nto append the note, \"This is Bosh,\" is prepared also to exalt him miles\\r\\nabove writers whose margins he would be quite content to leave without a\\r\\nsingle annotation of this—or any other—kind. In particular the variety\\r\\nof the books, and their vividness, are both extraordinary. And perhaps\\r\\nthe greatest notes of the novel generally, as well as those in which the\\r\\nnovel of this period can most successfully challenge comparison with\\r\\nthose of any other, are, or should be, vividness and variety. His books\\r\\nin the kind are seven; and the absence of replicas among them is one\\r\\nof their extraordinary features. Yeast, the first (1848), and Alton\\r\\nLocke, the second (next year), are novels of the unrest of thought\\r\\nwhich caused and accompanied the revolutionary movement of the period\\r\\nthroughout Europe. But they are quite different in subject and\\r\\ntreatment. The first is a sketch of country society, uppermost and\\r\\nlowermost:25 the second one of town-artisan and lower-trade life with\\r\\npassages of university and other contrast. Both are young and crude\\r\\nenough, intentionally or unintentionally; both, intentionally beyond\\r\\nall doubt, are fantastic and extravagant; but both are full of genius.\\r\\nArgemone Lavington, the heroine of Yeast, is, though not of the most\\r\\nelaborately drawn, one of the most fascinating and real heroines of\\r\\nEnglish fiction; an important secondary character of the second book,\\r\\nthe bookseller Sandy Mackaye, is one of its most successful\\r\\n\"character-parts.\" Both, but especially Yeast, are full of admirable\\r\\ndescriptive writing, not entirely without indebtedness to Mr. Ruskin,\\r\\nbut very often independently carried out, and always worthy of a \"place\\r\\non the line\" in any gallery. There is much accurate and real dialogue,\\r\\nnot a little firm character-drawing. Above all, both are full of\\r\\nblood—of things lived and seen, not vamped up from reading or\\r\\nday-dreaming—and yet full of dreams, day and other, and full of\\r\\nliterature. Perhaps \"the malt was a little above the meal,\" the yeast\\r\\npresent in more abundant quality than the substances for fermentation,\\r\\nbut there was no lack even of these.\\nHypatia—which succeeded after some interval (1853) and when the\\r\\nwriter\\'s Christian Socialist, Churchman-Chartist excitement had somewhat\\r\\nclarified itself—is a more substantial, a more ambitious, but certainly\\r\\nalso an even more successful book. It has something of—and perhaps,\\r\\nthough in far transposed matter, owes something to—Esmond in its\\r\\ndaring blend of old and new, and it falls short of that wonderful\\r\\ncreation. But it is almost a second to it: and, with plenty of faults,\\r\\nis perhaps the only classical or semi-classical novel of much value in\\r\\nEnglish.\\nBut it was in the next year, 1854, that Kingsley\\'s work reached its\\r\\ngreatest perfection in the brilliant historical novel of Westward Ho!\\r\\nwhere the glories of Elizabethan adventure and patriotism were treated\\r\\nwith a wonderful kindred enthusiasm, with admirable narrative faculty,\\r\\nwith a creation of character, suitable for the purpose, which is hardly\\r\\ninferior to that of the greatest masters, and with an even enhanced and\\r\\ncertainly chastened exercise of the descriptive faculty above noticed.\\r\\nThe book to some extent invited—and Kingsley availed himself of the\\r\\nopportunity in a far more than sufficient degree—that \"coat-trailing\"\\r\\nwhich, as has been said, inevitably in its turn provokes \"coat-treading\":\\r\\nand it has been abused from various quarters. But that it is one of\\r\\nthe very greatest of English novels next to the few supreme, impartial\\r\\nand competent criticism will never hesitate to allow. Of his remaining\\r\\nbooks of novel kind one was of the \"eccentric\" variety: the others,\\r\\nthough full of good things, were perhaps on the whole failures. The\\r\\nfirst referred to (the second in order of appearance), The Water\\r\\nBabies (1863), is a half Rabelaisian though perfectly inoffensive\\r\\nfatrasie of all sorts of things, exceedingly delightful to fit tastes.\\r\\nBut Two Tears Ago (1857), though containing some fine and even really\\r\\nexquisite things, shows a relaxing hand on the crudity and\\r\\npromiscuousness which had been excusable in his two first books and had\\r\\nbeen well restrained in Hypatia and Westward Ho! by central and\\r\\nactive interests of story and character. \"Spasmodic\" poetry, the Crimean\\r\\nWar, Pre-Raphaelitism, Tractarianism, the good and bad sides of science,\\r\\nand divers other things make a mixture that is not sufficiently\\r\\nconcocted and \"rectified.\" While in the much later Hereward the Wake\\r\\n(1866), though the provocation offered to the Dryasdust kind of\\r\\nhistorian is no matter, there is a curious relapse on the old fault of\\r\\nincorporating too much history or pseudo-history, and the same failure\\r\\nas in Two Tears Ago, or perhaps a greater one in degree, to concoct\\r\\nthe story (which is little more than a chronicle) together with a\\r\\ncertain neglect to conciliate the sympathies of the reader. But the\\r\\nwhole batch is a memorable collection; and it shows, rather\\r\\nexceptionally, the singular originality and variety of the novel at this\\r\\ntime.\\nThis remarkable pair may be supplemented by an in some ways more\\r\\nremarkable trio, all of them pretty close contemporaries, but, for\\r\\ndifferent reasons in each case, coming rather late into the novel\\r\\nfield—Charles Reade (b. 1814), Anthony Trollope (b. 1815), and Mary Ann\\r\\nEvans (b. 1819). It would be difficult to find three persons more\\r\\ndifferent in temperament; impossible to find more striking instances of\\r\\nthe way in which the new blend of romance and novel lent itself to the\\r\\nmost various uses and developments. Reade—who thought himself a\\r\\ndramatist and wasted upon drama a great deal of energy and an almost\\r\\nideal position as a possessor of an unusually rich fellowship at\\r\\nMagdalen College, Oxford, with no duties—came rather closer to Dickens\\r\\nthan to any novelist previously named, not merely in a sort of\\r\\nnon-poetic but powerful imagination, but also in the mania for attacking\\r\\nwhat seemed to him abuses—in lunatic asylums (on which point he was\\r\\nvery nearly a monomaniac himself), prisons, and many other things. But\\r\\nhe is almost more noteworthy, from our point of view, because of his\\r\\nuse—it also must, one fears, be called an abuse—of a process obviously\\r\\ninvited by the new demand for truth to life, and profitable up to a\\r\\ncertain point. This was the collection, in enormous scrapbooks, of\\r\\nnewspaper cuttings on a vast variety of subjects, to be worked up into\\r\\nfiction when the opportunity served. Reade had so much genius—he had\\r\\nperhaps the most, in a curious rather incalculable fashion, of the whole\\r\\ngroup—that he very nearly succeeded in digesting these \"marine stores\"\\r\\nof detail and document into real books. But he did not always, and\\r\\ncould not always, quite do it: and he remains, with Zola, the chief\\r\\nexample of the danger of working at your subject too much as if you were\\r\\ngetting up a brief, or preparing an article for an encyclopedia. Still,\\r\\nhis greatest books, which are probably It is Never too Late to Mend\\r\\n(1856) and The Cloister and the Hearth (1861), have immense vigour\\r\\nand, in the second case, an almost poetic attraction which Dickens never\\r\\nreaches, while over all sparks and veins of genius are scattered.\\r\\nMoreover, he is interesting because, until his own time, he would have\\r\\nbeen quite impossible; and, even at that time, without the general\\r\\nmovement which we are describing, very unlikely.\\nThere is not so much object here in discussing the much discussed\\r\\nquestion of the merits and defects of \"George Eliot\" (Mary Ann Evans or\\r\\nMrs. Cross) as a novelist, as there is in pointing out her relations to\\r\\nthis general movement. She began late, and almost accidentally; and\\r\\nthere is less unity in her general work than in some others here\\r\\nmentioned. Her earliest and perhaps, in adjusted and \"reduced\"\\r\\njudgments, her best work—Scenes of Clerical Life (1857-1858), Adam\\r\\nBede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner\\r\\n(1861)—consists of very carefully observed and skilfully rendered\\r\\nstudies of country life and character, tinged, especially in Adam Bede\\r\\nand The Mill on the Floss, with very intense and ambitious colours of\\r\\npassion. The great popularity of this tempted her into still more\\r\\nelaborate efforts of different kinds. Her attempt in quasi-historical\\r\\nromance, Romola (1865), was an enormous tour de force in which the\\r\\nwriter struggled to get historical and local colour, accurate and\\r\\nirreproachable, with all the desperation of the most conscientious\\r\\nrelater of actual history. Felix Holt the Radical (1866), Middle\\r\\nMarch (1872), and Daniel Deronda (1876) were equally elaborate\\r\\nsketches of modern English society, planned and engineered with the\\r\\nsame provision of carefully laboured plot, character, and phrase.\\r\\nAlthough received with enthusiasm by the partisans whom she had created\\r\\nfor herself, these books have seemed to some over-laboured, and if not\\r\\nexactly unreal, yet to a certain extent unnatural. But the point for us\\r\\nis their example of the way in which the novel—once a light and almost\\r\\nfrivolous thing—had come to be taken with the utmost seriousness—had\\r\\nin fact ceased to be light literature at all, and begun to require\\r\\nrigorous and elaborate training and preparation in the writer, perhaps\\r\\neven something of the athlete\\'s processes in the reader. Its state may\\r\\nor may not have advanced in grace pari passu with the advance in\\r\\neffort and in dignity: but this later advance is at least there.\\r\\nFielding himself took novel-writing by no means lightly, and Richardson\\r\\nstill less so: but imagine either, imagine Scott or even Miss Austen,\\r\\ngoing through the preliminary processes which seemed necessary, in\\r\\ndifferent ways, to Charles Reade and to Mary Ann Evans!\\nIn a certain sense, however, the last of the three, though he may give\\r\\nless impression of genius than the other two (or even the other four\\r\\nwhom we have specially noticed), is the most interesting of all: and\\r\\nqualms may sometimes arise as to whether genius is justly denied to him.\\r\\nAnthony Trollope, after a youth, not exactly orageuse, but apparently\\r\\ncharacterised by the rather squalid yet mild dissipation which he has\\r\\ndescribed in The Three Clerks (1858) and The Small House at\\r\\nAllington (1864), attained a considerable position in the Post Office\\r\\nwhich he held during great part of his career as a novelist. For some\\r\\ntime that career did not look as if it were going to be a successful\\r\\none, though his early (chiefly Irish) efforts are better than is\\r\\nsometimes thought. But he made his mark first with The Warden (1855),\\r\\nand then, much more directly and triumphantly, with its sequel\\r\\nBarchester Towers (1857). When the first of these was published\\r\\nDickens had been a successful novelist for nearly twenty years and\\r\\nThackeray had \"come to his own\" for nearly ten. The Warden might have\\r\\nbeen described at the time (I do not know whether it was, but English\\r\\nreviewing was only beginning to be clever again) as a partial attempt at\\r\\nthe matter of Dickens in a partial following of the manner of Thackeray.\\r\\nAn \"abuse\"—the distribution in supposed unjust proportion of the funds\\r\\nof an endowed hospital for aged men—is its main avowed subject. But\\r\\nTrollope indulged in no tirades and no fantastic-grotesque\\r\\ncaricature—in fact he actually drew a humorous sketch of a novel à la\\r\\nDickens on the matter. His real object was evidently to sketch\\r\\nfaithfully, but again not without humour, the cathedral society of\\r\\n\"Barchester\" as it actually spoke, dressed, thought, and lived: and he\\r\\ndid it. The first book had a little too much talk about the nominal\\r\\nsubject, and not enough actual action and conversation. Barchester\\r\\nTowers remedied this, and presented its readers with one of the\\r\\nliveliest books in English fiction. There had been nothing like it (for\\r\\nThackeray had been more discursive and less given to small talk) since\\r\\nMiss Austen herself, though the spirits of the two were extremely\\r\\ndifferent. Perhaps Trollope never did a better book than this, for\\r\\nvariety and vigour of character drawing. The masterful wife of Bishop\\r\\nProudie, the ne\\'er-do-weel canon\\'s family (the Stanhopes), and others\\r\\nstand out against an interest, not intense but sufficient, of story, a\\r\\ngreat variety of incident, and above all abundant and lifelike\\r\\nconversation. For many years, and in an extraordinary number of\\r\\nexamples, he fell little below, and perhaps once or twice went above,\\r\\nthis standard. It was rather a fancy of his (one again, perhaps,\\r\\nsuggested by Thackeray) to run his books into series or cycles—the\\r\\nchief being that actually opened as above, and continuing through others\\r\\nto the brilliant Last Chronicle of Barset (1867), which in some\\r\\nrespect surpasses Barchester Towers itself, with a second series, not\\r\\nquite disconnected, dealing with Lady Glencora Palliser as centre, and\\r\\nyet others. His total production was enormous: it became in fact\\r\\nimpossibly so, and the work of his last lustrum and a little more (say\\r\\n1877-1882), though never exactly bad or painful to read, was obvious\\r\\nhack-work. But between The Warden and The American Senator,\\r\\ntwenty-two years later, he had written nearer thirty than twenty novels,\\r\\nof which at least half were much above the average and some quite\\r\\ncapital.26 Moreover, it is a noteworthy thing, and contrary to some\\r\\ncritical explanations, that, as his works drop out of copyright and are\\r\\nreprinted in cheap editions, they appear to be recovering very\\r\\nconsiderable popularity. This fact would seem to show that the manners,\\r\\nspeech, etc., represented in them have a certain standard quality which\\r\\ndoes not—like the manner, speech, etc., of novels such as those of Hook\\r\\nand Surtees—lose appeal to fresh generations; and that the artist who\\r\\ndealt with them must have had not a little faculty of fixing them in the\\r\\npresentation. In fact it is probably not too much to say that of the\\r\\naverage novel of the third quarter of the century—in a more than\\r\\naverage but not of an extraordinary, transcendental, or quintessential\\r\\ncondition—Anthony Trollope is about as good a representative as can be\\r\\nfound. His talent is individual enough, but not too individual: system\\r\\nand writer may each have the credit due to them allotted without\\r\\ndifficulty.\\nA novelist who might have been in front of the first flight of these in\\r\\npoint of time, and who is actually put by some in the first flight in\\r\\npoint of merit, is Mrs. Gaskell. Born in 1810, she accumulated the\\r\\nmaterial for her future Cranford at Knutsford in Cheshire: but did not\\r\\npublish this till after Dickens had, in 1850, established Household\\r\\nWords, where it appeared in instalments. She had a little earlier, in\\r\\n1848, published her first novel, Mary Barton—a vivid but distinctly\\r\\none-sided picture of factory life in Lancashire. In the same year with\\r\\nthe collected Cranford (1853) appeared Ruth, also a \"strife-novel\"\\r\\n(as the Germans would say) though in a different way: and two years\\r\\nlater what is perhaps her most elaborate effort, North and South. A\\r\\nyear or two before her death in 1865 Sylvia\\'s Lovers was warmly\\r\\nwelcomed by some: and the unfinished Wives and Daughters, which was\\r\\nactually interrupted by that death, has been considered her maturest\\r\\nwork. Her famous and much controverted Life of Charlotte Brontë does\\r\\nnot belong to us, except in so far as it knits the two novelists\\r\\ntogether.\\nFrom hints dropped already, it may be seen that the present writer does\\r\\nnot find Mrs. Gaskell his easiest subject. There is much in her work\\r\\nwhich, in Hobbes\\'s phrase, is both \"an effect of power and a cause of\\r\\npleasure\": but there appears to some to be in her a pervading want of\\r\\nactual success—of réussite—absolute and unquestionable. The sketches\\r\\nof Cranford are very agreeable and very admirable performances in the\\r\\nmanner first definitely thrown out by Addison, and turned to consummate\\r\\nperfection in the way of the regular novel (which be it remembered\\r\\nCranford is not) by Miss Austen. But the mere mention of the last\\r\\nname kills them. The author of Emma would have treated Miss Matty and\\r\\nthe rest much less lovingly, but she would have made them persons. Mrs.\\r\\nGaskell has left them mere types of amiable country-townishness in\\r\\nrespectable if not very lively times. Excessive respectability cannot be\\r\\ncharged against Mary Barton and Ruth, but here the \"problem\"—the\\r\\n\"purpose\"—interposes its evil influence: and we have got to take a side\\r\\nwith men or with masters, with selfish tempters of one class and deluded\\r\\nmaidens of another. North and South is perhaps on the whole the best\\r\\nplace in which to study Mrs. Gaskell\\'s art: for Wives and Daughters is\\r\\nunfinished and the books just named are tentatives. It begins by laying\\r\\na not inconsiderable hold on the reader: and, as it is worked out at\\r\\ngreat length, the author has every opportunity of strengthening and\\r\\nimproving that hold. It is certain that, in some cases, she does not do\\r\\nthis: and the reason is the same—the failure to project and keep in\\r\\naction definite and independent characters, and the attempt to make\\r\\nweight and play with purposes and problems. The heroine\\'s father—who\\r\\nresigns his living and exposes his delicate wife and only daughter, if\\r\\nnot exactly to privation, to discomfort and, in the wife\\'s case, fatally\\r\\nunsuitable surroundings, because of some never clearly defined\\r\\ndissatisfaction with the creed of the Church (not apparently with\\r\\nChristianity as such or with Anglicanism as such), and who dies\\r\\n\"promiscuously,\" to be followed, in equally promiscuous fashion, by a\\r\\nfriend who leaves his daughter Margaret a fortune—is one of those\\r\\nnearly contemptible imbeciles in whom it is impossible to take an\\r\\ninterest. In respect to the wife Mrs. Gaskell commits the curious\\r\\nmistake of first suggesting that she is a complainer about nothing, and\\r\\nthen showing her to us as a suffering victim of her husband\\'s folly and\\r\\nof hopeless disease. The lover (who is to a great extent a replica of\\r\\nthe masterful mill-owner in Shirley) is uncertain and impersonal: and\\r\\nthe minor characters are null. One hopes, for a time, that Margaret\\r\\nherself will save the situation: but she goes off instead of coming on,\\r\\nand has rather less individuality and convincingness at the end of the\\r\\nstory than at the beginning. In short, Mrs. Gaskell seems to me one of\\r\\nthe chief illustrations of the extreme difficulty of the domestic\\r\\nnovel—of the necessity of exactly proportioning the means at command to\\r\\nthe end to be achieved. Her means were, perhaps, greater than those of\\r\\nmost of her brother-and-sister-novelists, but she set them to loose\\r\\nends, to ends too high for her, to ends not worth achieving: end thus\\r\\nproduced (again as it seems to me) flawed and unsatisfactory work. She\\r\\n\"means\" well in Herbert\\'s sense of the word: but what is meant is not\\r\\nquite done.\\nTo mention special books and special writers is not the first object of\\r\\nthis survey, though it would be very easy to double and redouble its\\r\\nsize by doing this, even within the time-limits of this, the last, and\\r\\nthe next chapters. It may, however, be added that in this remarkable\\r\\ncentral period, and in the most central part of it from 1840 to 1860,\\r\\nthere appeared the first remarkable novel of Mr. George Meredith, The\\r\\nOrdeal of Richard Feverel (1859), first of a brilliant series that was\\r\\nto illustrate the whole remaining years of the century; and the isolated\\r\\nmasterpiece of Phantastes, which another prolific writer, George\\r\\nMacdonald, was never to repeat; while Mrs. Oliphant and Mrs. Craik, both\\r\\nof whom will also reappear in the next chapter, began as early as 1849.\\r\\nIn 1851 appeared the first of two remarkable books, Lavengro and The\\r\\nRomany Rye, in which George Borrow, if he did not exactly create,\\r\\nbrought to perfection from some points of view what may be called the\\r\\nautobiographic novel.\\nIndeed the memory of the aged and the industry of the young could recall\\r\\nor rediscover dozens and scores of noteworthy books, some of which have\\r\\nnot lost actual or traditional reputation, such as the Paul Ferroll\\r\\n(1855) of Mrs. Archer Clive, a well-restrained crime-novel, the story of\\r\\nwhich is indicated in the title of its sequel, Why Paul Ferroll killed\\r\\nhis Wife. Henry Kingsley, George Alfred Lawrence, Wilkie Collins, and\\r\\nothers began their careers at this time. The best book ever written\\r\\nabout school, Tom Brown\\'s School Days (1857), and the best book in\\r\\nlighter vein ever written about Oxford, Mr. Verdant Green (1853-1856),\\r\\nboth appeared in the fifties.\\nAlthough, indeed, the intenser and more individual genius of the great\\r\\nnovelists of this time went rather higher than the specialist novel, it\\r\\nwas, in certain directions, well cultivated during this period. Men\\r\\nlikely to write naval novels of merit were dying out, and though Lever\\r\\ntook up the military tale, at second hand, with brilliant results, the\\r\\nsame historical causes were in operation there. But a comparatively new\\r\\nkind—the \"sporting\" novel—developed itself largely and in some cases\\r\\nwent beyond mere sport. Such early books as Egan\\'s Tom and Jerry\\r\\n(1821) can hardly be called novels: but as the love of sport extended\\r\\nand the term itself ceased to designate merely on the one side the\\r\\npleasures of country squires, and on the other the amusements (sometimes\\r\\nrather blackguard in character) of men about town, the general subject\\r\\nmade a lodgment in fiction. One of its most characteristic practitioners\\r\\nwas Robert Smith Surtees, who, before Dickens and perhaps acting as\\r\\nsuggester of the original plan of Pickwick (not that which Dickens\\r\\nsubstituted), excogitated (between 1831 and 1838) the remarkable\\r\\nfictitious personage of \"Mr. Jorrocks,\" grocer and sportsman, whose\\r\\nadventures, and those of other rather hybrid characters of the same\\r\\nkind, he pursued through a number of books for some thirty years. These\\r\\n(though in strict character, and in part of their manners, deficient as\\r\\nabove noticed) were nearly always readable—and sometimes very\\r\\namusing—even to those who are not exactly Nimrods: and they were\\r\\ngreatly commended to others still by the admirable illustrations of\\r\\nLeech. There is not a little sound sport in Kingsley and afterwards in\\r\\nAnthony Trollope: while the novels of Frank Smedley, Frank Fairlegh\\r\\n(1850), Lewis Arundel (1852), and Harry Coverdale\\'s Courtship\\r\\n(1855), mix a good deal more of it with some good fun and some rather\\r\\nrococo romance. The subject became, indeed, very popular in the fifties,\\r\\nand entered largely into, though it by no means exclusively occupied,\\r\\nthe novels of George John Whyte-Melville, a Fifeshire gentleman, an\\r\\nEtonian, and a guardsman, who, after retiring from the army, served\\r\\nagain in the Crimean War, and, after writing a large number of novels,\\r\\nwas killed in the hunting field. Some of Whyte-Melville\\'s books, such as\\r\\nMarket Harborough (1861), are hunting novels pure and simple, so much\\r\\nso that it has been said (rashly) that none but hunting men and women\\r\\ncan read them. Others, such as Kate Coventry (1856), a very lively and\\r\\nagreeable book, mix sport with general character and manners-painting.\\r\\nOthers, such as Holmby House (1860), The Queen\\'s Maries (1862),\\r\\netc., attempt the historical style. But perhaps this mixed novel of\\r\\nsport, society, and a good deal of love-making reached its most curious\\r\\ndevelopment in the novels of George Alfred Lawrence, from the once\\r\\nfamous Guy Livingstone (1857) onwards—a series almost typical, which\\r\\nwas developed further, with touches of original but uncritical talent,\\r\\nwhich often dropped into unintentional caricature, by the late \"Ouida\"\\r\\n(Louise de La Ramée). All the three last writers mentioned, however,\\r\\nespecially the last two, made sport only an ingredient in their novel\\r\\ncomposition (\"Ouida,\" in fact, knew nothing about it) and at least\\r\\nendeavoured, according to their own ideas and ideals, to grapple with\\r\\nlarger parts of life. The danger of the kind showed less in them than in\\r\\nsome imitators of a lower class, of whom Captain Hawley Smart was the\\r\\nchief, and a chief sometimes better than his own followers. Some even of\\r\\nhis books are quite interesting: but in a few of them, and in more of\\r\\nother writers, the obligation to tell something like a story and to\\r\\nprovide something like characters seems to be altogether forgotten. A\\r\\nrun (or several runs) with the hounds, a steeplechase and its\\r\\npreparations and accidents, one at least of the great races and the\\r\\ntraining and betting preliminary to them—these form the real and almost\\r\\nthe sole staple of story; so that a tolerably intelligent office-boy\\r\\ncould make them up out of a number or two of the Field, a sufficient\\r\\nlist of proper names, and a commonplace book of descriptions. This, in\\r\\nfact, is the danger of the specialist novel generally: though perhaps it\\r\\ndoes not show quite so glaringly in other cases. Yet, even here, that\\r\\nnote of the fiction of the whole century—its tendency to \"accaparate\"\\r\\nand utilise all the forms of life, all the occupations and amusements of\\r\\nmankind—shows itself notably enough.\\nSo, too, one notable book has, here even more than elsewhere, often set\\r\\ngoing hosts of imitations. Tom Brown\\'s School Days, for instance\\r\\n(1857), flooded the market with school stories, mostly very bad. But\\r\\nthere is one division which did more justice to a higher class of\\r\\nsubject and produced some very remarkable work in what is called the\\r\\nreligious novel, though, here as elsewhere, the better examples did not\\r\\nmerely harp on one string.\\nA very interesting off-shoot of the domestic novel, ignored or despised\\r\\nby the average critic and rather perfunctorily treated even by those who\\r\\nhave taken it as a special subject, is the \"Tractarian\" or High-Church\\r\\nnovel, which, originating very shortly after the movement itself had\\r\\nbegan, had no small share in popularising it. The earlier Evangelicals\\r\\nhad by no means neglected fiction as a means of propagating their views,\\r\\nespecially among the young. Mrs. Sherwood in Little Henry and his\\r\\nBearer and The Fairchild Family (1818) and \"Charlotte Elizabeth\"\\r\\n(Browne or Tonna) are examples. But the High-Church party, in accordance\\r\\nwith its own predecessors and patterns in the seventeenth century,\\r\\nalways maintained, during its earlier and better period, a higher\\r\\nstandard of scholarship and of general literary culture. Its early\\r\\nefforts in fiction—according to the curious and most interesting law\\r\\nwhich seems to decree that every subdivision of a kind shall go through\\r\\nsomething like the vicissitudes of the kind at large—were not strictly\\r\\nnovels but romance, and romance of the allegorical kind. In the late\\r\\nthirties and early forties the allegorists, the chief of whom were\\r\\nSamuel Wilberforce and William Adams, were busy and effective. The\\r\\nfuture bishop\\'s Agathos (before 1840) is a very spirited and\\r\\nwell-written adaptation of the \"whole armour of God\" theme so often\\r\\nre-allegorised: and Adams\\'s Shadow of the Cross is only the best of\\r\\nseveral good stories—of a rather more feminine type, but graceful,\\r\\nsound enough in a general way, and combining the manners of Spenser and\\r\\nBunyan with no despicable skill. If, however, the Tractarian\\r\\nfiction-writers had confined themselves to allegory there would be no\\r\\nnecessity to do more than glance at them, for allegory, on the obvious\\r\\nBiblical suggestion, has been a constant instrument of combined\\r\\nreligious instruction and pastime. But they went much further afield.\\r\\nSometimes the excursions were half satirical, as in the really amusing\\r\\nOwlet of Owlstone Edge and The Curate of Cumberworth and the Vicar of\\r\\nRoost of Francis Paget, attacking, the slovenly neglect and supineness\\r\\nwhich, quite as much as unsound doctrine, was the bête noire of the\\r\\nearly Anglo-Catholics. William Gresley and others wrote stories mostly\\r\\nfor the young. But the distinguishing feature of the school, and that\\r\\nwhich gives it an honourable and more than an honorary place here, was\\r\\nthe shape which, before the middle of the century, it took in the hands\\r\\nof two ladies, Elizabeth Sewell and Charlotte Mary Yonge.\\nThe first, who was the elder but survived Miss Yonge and died at a very\\r\\ngreat age quite recently, had much less talent than her junior: but\\r\\nundoubtedly deserves the credit of setting the style. In her novels\\r\\n(Gertrude, Katharine Ashton, etc.) she carried, even farther than Miss\\r\\nAusten, the principle of confining herself rigidly to the events of\\r\\nordinary life. Not that she eschews the higher middle or even the higher\\r\\nclasses: though, on the other hand, Katharine Ashton, evidently one of\\r\\nher favourite heroines, is the daughter of a shopkeeper. But the law of\\r\\naverage and ordinary character, incident, atmosphere, is observed almost\\r\\ninvariably. Unfortunately Miss Sewell (she was actually a\\r\\nschoolmistress) let the didactic part of her novels get rather too much\\r\\nthe upper hand: and though she wrote good English, possessed no special\\r\\ngrace of style, and little faculty of illustration or ornament from\\r\\nhistory, literature, her own fancy, current fashions, even of the most\\r\\nharmless kind, and so forth. The result is that her books have a certain\\r\\ndead-aliveness—that the characters, though actually alive, are neither\\r\\ninterestingly alive nor, as Miss Austen had made hers, interesting in\\r\\ntheir very uninterestingness. Sometimes, for a scene or two, her truth\\r\\nto nature and fact is rewarded by that curious sense of recognition\\r\\nwhich the reader feels in the presence of actual mimesis—of creation\\r\\nof fictitious fact and person. But this is not common: and the epithet\\r\\n\"dull,\" which too commonly only stigmatises the person using it, may\\r\\nreally suggest itself not seldom in reference to Miss Sewell. A \"success\\r\\nof esteem\" is about the utmost that can be accorded her.\\nWith Miss Yonge the case was very different. She was a lady of wide\\r\\nreading and, even according to the modern rather arbitrary restrictions\\r\\nof the term, something of an historical scholar; she had humour, of\\r\\nwhich there was scarcely a particle in Miss Sewell\\'s composition; she\\r\\nhad a very considerable understanding, and consequently some toleration\\r\\nof the infinite varieties, and at least the more venial foibles, of\\r\\nhuman temperament. She possessed an inexhaustible command of dialogue\\r\\nwhich was always natural and sometimes very far from trivial; and if she\\r\\nhad no command of the greater novelists\\' imagination in the creation of\\r\\ncharacter and story, she had an almost uncanny supply of invention, of\\r\\nwhat may be called the second or third class, in these respects. She\\r\\nwrote too much and too long; but it cannot be said that she ever merely\\r\\nrepeated herself. And her best books—the famous Heir of Redclyffe\\r\\n(1853), which captivated William Morris and his friends at Oxford, and\\r\\nwhich, with a little unnecessary sentimentality and a little\\r\\n\"unco-guidness,\" is full of cleverness, nature, good sense, good taste,\\r\\nand good form; Heartsease (1854), perhaps the best of all; Dynevor\\r\\nTerrace (1857), less of a general favourite but full of good things;\\r\\nand the especially popular Daisy Chain (1856), with not a few\\r\\nothers—are things which no courageous and catholic critic of fiction\\r\\nwill ever be tired of defending or (which is not always the same thing)\\r\\nof reading. Some of her early tales, before these, were a little \"raw\":\\r\\nand most of her later work showed (as did Anthony Trollope\\'s and that of\\r\\nother though not all very prolific novelists) that the field had been\\r\\novercropped. But she was hardly ever dull: and she always had that\\r\\nquality—if not of the supreme artist, of the real craftsman—which\\r\\nprevents a thing from being a failure. What is meant is done: though\\r\\nperhaps it might have been meant higher.\\nThe comparison, backwards and forwards, of this great company of novels\\r\\nis of endless interest; perhaps one of many aspects of that interest may\\r\\nbe touched on specially, because it connects itself with much else that\\r\\nhas been said. If we read, together or in near sequence, three such\\r\\nbooks as, say, Emilia Wyndbam, Pendennis, and Yeast, all of which\\r\\nappeared close together, between 1846 and 1849, the differences, in\\r\\nquality and volume of individual genius, will of course strike every one\\r\\nforcibly. But some will also be struck by something else—the difference\\r\\nbetween the first and the other two in style or (as that word is\\r\\nalmost hopelessly ambiguous) let us perhaps say diction. Both\\r\\nThackeray and Kingsley are almost perfectly modern in this. We may not\\r\\nspeak so well to-day, and we may have added more slang and jargon to our\\r\\nspeech, but there is no real difference, except in these respects,\\r\\nbetween a speech of Pen\\'s (when not talking book) or one of Colonel\\r\\nBracebridge\\'s, and the speech of any gentleman who is a barrister or a\\r\\nguardsman at this hour. The excellent Mrs. Marsh had not arrived at that\\r\\npoint; what some people call the \"stilted\" forms and phrases of fifty or\\r\\nalmost a hundred years earlier clung to her still. The resulting lingo\\r\\nis far better than that part of the lingo of to-day where literary and\\r\\nlinguistic good manners have been forgotten altogether: but it is\\r\\ndistinctly deficient in ease. There are endless flourishes and\\r\\nperiphrases—the colloquialisms which Swift and others had denounced\\r\\n(and quite properly) in their ugliest and vulgarest forms are not even\\r\\npermitted entrance in improved and warranted varieties. You must never\\r\\nsay \"won\\'t\" but always \"will not,\" whereas the ability to use the two\\r\\nforms adds infinite propriety as well as variety to the dialogue. You\\r\\nsay, \"At length a most unfortunate accident aggravated (if aggravation\\r\\nwere possible) the unfortunate circumstances of the situation.\" You\\r\\naddress your own characters in the oratorical manner of Mr. Burke and\\r\\nother great men, \"Ah, Mr. Danby! if instead, etc.\" In short, instead of\\r\\nreserving the grand manner (and a rather different grand manner) for\\r\\ngrand occasions, you maintain a sort of cheap machine-made kind of it\\r\\nthroughout. The real secret of the novel was not found out till this was\\r\\ndiscarded. Perhaps that real secret does not lie so much anywhere else\\r\\nas here.\\nA few words may not improperly be said about some of the circumstances\\r\\nand details of novel-appearance and distribution, etc., at this palmy\\r\\nday of English fiction. At what time the famous \"three-decker\" was\\r\\nconsecrated as the regular novel line-of-battle-ship I have not been\\r\\nable to determine exactly to my own satisfaction. Richardson had\\r\\nextended his interminable narrations to seven or eight volumes: Miss\\r\\nBurney latterly had not been content with less than five. From the\\r\\nspecimens I have examined, I have an idea that with the \"Minerva Press\"\\r\\nand its contemporaries and successors at the end of the eighteenth and\\r\\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, four was a very favourite if not\\r\\nthe most usual number. But these volumes were usually small—not much\\r\\nlarger than those of the Belgian reprints of Dumas which, as one\\r\\nremembers, used to run into the dozen or something like it in the case\\r\\nof his longer books. Three, however, has obvious advantages; the chief\\r\\nof them being the adjustment to \"beginning, middle, and end,\" though\\r\\nthere is a corresponding disadvantage which soon developed itself—and\\r\\nin fact, finally, I have no doubt helped to ruin the form—the\\r\\ntemptation to make the second volume a place of mere padding. But the\\r\\nactual popularity of \"the old three-decker\" continued for quite two\\r\\ngenerations, if not more, and was unmistakable. Library subscriptions\\r\\nwere generally adjusted to it; and any circulating-library keeper would\\r\\ntell you that, putting this quite aside, even subscribers to more or\\r\\nfewer volumes than three would take the three-volume by preference. More\\r\\nthan this, still, there is a curious fact necessarily known to\\r\\ncomparatively few people. Although it was improper of Mr. Bludyer to\\r\\nsell his novel, and dine and drink of the profits before \"smashing\" it,\\r\\nthere were probably not many reviewers who did not get rid of most of\\r\\ntheir books of this kind, if for no other reasons than that no house,\\r\\nshort of a palace, would have held them all. And, in the palmy days of\\r\\ncirculating libraries, the price given by second-hand booksellers for\\r\\nnovels made a very considerable addition to the reviewer\\'s remuneration\\r\\nor guerdon. But these booksellers would not pay, in proportion, for two\\r\\nor one volume books—alleging, what no doubt was true, that the\\r\\nlibraries had a lower tariff for them. Further, the short story, now so\\r\\npopular, was very unpopular in those days: and library customers would\\r\\nrefuse collections of them with something like indignation or disgust.\\r\\nIndeed, there are reviewers living who may perhaps pride themselves on\\r\\nhaving done something to drive the dislike out and the liking in.\\nThe circulating library itself, though not the creation of the novel,\\r\\nwas very largely extended by it, and helped no doubt very largely to\\r\\nextend the circulation of the novel in turn. Before it, to some extent,\\r\\nand long before so-called \"public\" or \"free\" libraries, books in general\\r\\nand novels in particular had been very largely diffused by clubs,\\r\\n\"institutions,\" and other forms of co-operative individual enterprise,\\r\\nthe bookplates of which will be found in many a copy of an old novel\\r\\nnow. Sometimes these were purely private associations of neighbours:\\r\\nsometimes they belonged to more or less extensive establishments, like\\r\\nthat defunct \"Russell Institution in Great Coram Street,\" which a great\\r\\nauthor, who was its neighbour, once took for an example of desolation;\\r\\nor the still existing and flourishing \"Philosophical\" examples in\\r\\nEdinburgh and Bath. In these latter cases, of course, novels were not\\r\\nallowed to be the main constituents of the library; in fact in some, but\\r\\nfew, they may have been sternly excluded. On the other hand, the\\r\\nprivate-adventure circulating libraries tended more and more, with few\\r\\nexceptions, to rely on novels only—\"Mudie\\'s\" and a few more being\\r\\nexceptions. Very few people, I suppose, ever bought three-volume novels;\\r\\nand the fact that they went almost wholly to the libraries, and were\\r\\nthere worn to pieces, accounts for the comparative rarity of good\\r\\ncopies. The circulating library has survived both the decease of the\\r\\nthree-volume novel and the competition of the so-called free library.\\r\\nBut it is pretty certain that it was a chief cause—and almost the whole\\r\\nsustaining cause—of the three-volume system itself. Nor was the\\r\\nconnection between nature of form and system of distribution limited to\\r\\nEngland: for the single-volume novel, though older in France than with\\r\\nus, is not so very old.\\nBut a very considerable proportion of these famous books made\\r\\nappearances previous to that in three volumes, and not distantly\\r\\nconnected with their popularity. For the most part these previous\\r\\nappearances were either in magazines or periodicals of one kind and\\r\\nanother, or else in \"parts.\"\\nNeither process was exactly new, though both were largely affected\\r\\nby changed conditions of general literature and life. The\\r\\nmagazine-appearance traces itself, by almost insensible gradations, to\\r\\nthe original periodical-essay of the Steele-Addison type—the small\\r\\nindividual bulk of which necessitated division of whatsoever was not\\r\\nitself on a very small scale. If you run down the \"Contents\" of the\\r\\nBritish Essayists you will constantly find \"Continuation of the story\\r\\nof Alonso and Imoinda\" and the like. But when, in the early years of the\\r\\nnineteenth century, the system of newspapers and periodicals branched\\r\\nout into endless development, coincidently with the increase of demand\\r\\nand supply in regard to the novel, it was inevitable that this latter\\r\\nshould be drawn upon to supply at once the standing dishes and the\\r\\nrelishes of the entertainment. Blackwood and the London, the first\\r\\nfruits of the new kind, did not at once take to the novel by\\r\\ninstalments: and the London had no time to do so. But Blackwood\\r\\nsoon became celebrated—a reputation which it has never lost—for the\\r\\nexcellence of its short stories, and by degrees took to long ones; while\\r\\nits followers—Fraser, Bentley\\'s Miscellany, The Dublin University\\r\\nMagazine, the New Monthly, and others—almost from the first bated\\r\\ntheir hooks with this new appât. A very large proportion of the work\\r\\nof the novelists mentioned in the last chapter, as well as of Lever,\\r\\nappeared in one or other of these. Fraser in particular was\\r\\nThackeray\\'s chief refuge in the Days of Ignorance of the public as to\\r\\nhis real powers and merits, while, just as he was going off, the very\\r\\ndifferent work of Kingsley came on there. And the tradition, as is well\\r\\nknown, has never been broken. The particular magazines may have died in\\r\\nsome cases: but the magazine-appearance of novels is nearly as vivacious\\r\\nas ever.\\nPublication in parts is nearly as old, but has a less continuous\\r\\nhistory, and has seen itself suffer an interruption of life. There are\\r\\nscattered examples of it pretty far back both in France and England.\\r\\nMarivaux had a particular fancy for it: with the result that he left not\\r\\na little of his work unfinished. Such volume-publication as that of\\r\\nTristram Shandy, in batches really small in quantity and at fairly\\r\\nregular if long intervals, is not much different from part-issue. As the\\r\\ntaste for reading spread to classes with not much ready money, and\\r\\nperhaps, in some cases, living at a distance from libraries, this taste\\r\\nspread too. But I do not think there can be much doubt that the immense\\r\\nsuccess of Dickens—in combination with his own very distinct\\r\\npredilection for keeping the ring himself and being his own editor—had\\r\\nmost to do with its prevalence during the period under present\\r\\nconsideration. Thackeray took up the practice from him: as well as\\r\\nothers both from him and from Thackeray. The great illustrators, too, of\\r\\nthe forties, fifties, and sixties, from Cruikshank and Browne to\\r\\nFrederick Walker, were partly helped by the system, partly helped to\\r\\nmake it popular. But the circulating libraries did not like it for\\r\\nobvious reasons, the parts being fragile and unsubstantial: and the\\r\\ngreat success of cheap magazines, on the pattern of Macmillan\\'s and\\r\\nthe Cornhill, cut the ground from under its feet. The last remarkable\\r\\nnovel that I remember seeing in the form was The Last Chronicle of\\r\\nBarset. Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda came out in parts which were\\r\\nrather volumes than parts.\\nThis piece-meal publication, whether in part or periodical, could not be\\r\\nwithout some effects on the character of the production. These were\\r\\nneither wholly good nor wholly bad. They served to some extent to\\r\\ncorrect the tendency, mentioned above, of the three-volume novel to \"go\\r\\nto seed\" in the middle—to become a sort of preposterous sandwich with\\r\\nmeat on the outsides and a great slab of ill-baked and insipid bread\\r\\nbetween. For readers would not have stood this in instalments: you had\\r\\nto provide some bite or promise of bite in each—if possible—indeed to\\r\\nleave each off at an interesting point. But this itself rather tended to\\r\\na jumpy and ill-composed whole—to that mechanical shift from one part\\r\\nof the plot to another which is so evident, for instance, in Trollope:\\r\\nand there was worse temptation behind. If a man had the opportunity, the\\r\\nmeans, the courage, and the artistic conscience necessary to finish his\\r\\nwork before any part of it appeared, or at least to scaffold it\\r\\nthoroughly throughout in advance, no harm was done. But perhaps there is\\r\\nno class of people with whom the temptation—common enough in every\\r\\nclass—of hand-to-mouth work is more fatal than with men of letters. It\\r\\nis said that even the clergy are human enough to put off their\\r\\nsermon-writing till Saturday, and what can be expected of the profane\\r\\nman, especially when he has a whole month apparently before him? It is\\r\\npretty certain that Thackeray succumbed to this temptation: and so did a\\r\\ngreat many people who could much less afford to do so than Thackeray.\\r\\nIt was almost certainly responsible for part of the astonishing\\r\\nmedley of repetitions and lapses in Lever: and I am by no means\\r\\nsure that some of Dickens\\'s worst faults, especially the ostentatious\\r\\nplot-that-is-no-plot of such a book as Little Dorrit—the plot which\\r\\nmarks time with elaborate gesticulation and really does not advance at\\r\\nall—were not largely due to the system.\\nLet it only be added that these expensive forms of publication by no\\r\\nmeans excluded cheap reprints as soon as a book was really popular. The\\r\\nvery big people kept up their prices: but everybody else was glad to get\\r\\ninto \"popular libraries,\" yellow-backed railway issues, and the like, as\\r\\nsoon as possible.\\nIt will have been seen that the present writer puts the novel of\\r\\n1845-1870 very high: he would indeed put it, in its own compartment,\\r\\nalmost on a level with the drama of 1585-1625 or the poems of 1798-1825.\\r\\nJust at the present moment there may be a pretty general tendency to\\r\\nconsider this allowance exaggerated if not preposterous: and to set it\\r\\ndown to the well-known foible of age for the period of its own youth.\\r\\nThere is no need to do more than suggest that those who were young when\\r\\nShakespeare, or when Byron, died, would not have been exactly in their\\r\\ndotage if, forty years later, they had extolled the literature of their\\r\\nnonage. One does not care to dwell long on such a point: but it may just\\r\\nbe observed that the present writer\\'s withers are hardly even pinched,\\r\\nlet alone wrung, by the strictest application, to his case, of this\\r\\nrather idle notion. For some of what he is praising as the best novels\\r\\nwere written before he was born; many while he was in the nursery; most\\r\\nbefore he had left school, and practically all before he had ceased to\\r\\nbe an undergraduate. Now acute observers know that what may be called\\r\\nthe disease of contemporary partisanship rarely even begins till the\\r\\nundergraduate period, and is at its severest from twenty-five to\\r\\nthirty-five. I would undertake that most of our reviewers who discover\\r\\nShakespeares and Sainte-Beuves, improved Thackerays and bettered\\r\\nMolières, week by week or day by day, count their years between these\\r\\nlimits. Beati illi from some points of view, but from others, if they\\r\\ngo on longer, Heaven help them indeed!\\nBut all this is really idle. A critic is not right or wrong because he\\r\\nis young or old as the case may be; because he follows the taste of his\\r\\nage or runs counter to it; because he likes the past or because he likes\\r\\nthe present. He is right or wrong according as he does or does not like\\r\\nthe right things in the right way. And it is a simple historical fact,\\r\\ncapable now of being seen in a proper perspective, and subjected to the\\r\\nproper historical tests, that, in the large sense, the two generations\\r\\nfrom the appearance of Scott and Miss Austen to the death of Dickens\\r\\n(and considering the ebb which followed Scott and Miss Austen\\r\\nthemselves, specially the latter of these two), supplied the spring tide\\r\\nof the novel-flood, the flower-time of its flowering season, the acme of\\r\\nits climax.\\nThe comparison, both in the longer and shorter time, to the great summer\\r\\nof the drama may be too complimentary—I do not think it is, except in\\r\\nso far as that drama necessarily involved poetry, a higher thing by far\\r\\nthan either drama itself or novel—but it is certainly not an altogether\\r\\ncomfortable one. For we know that the drama, thereafter, has never had a\\r\\nmore than galvanised life, except in the imagination of the gentlemen\\r\\nwho discover Shakespeares and Molières as aforesaid. And there are those\\r\\nwho say that, not only at the moment, but for some time past, the state\\r\\nof the novel is, and has been, not much more promising. The student who\\r\\nis thoroughly broken to the study of literary history is never a\\r\\npessimist, though he may be very rarely an optimist: for the one thing\\r\\nof which he should be thoroughly convinced is its incalculableness. But\\r\\nhe might admit—while reserving unlimited trust in the Wind of the\\r\\nSpirit and its power to blow exactly as it listeth, and to awaken the\\r\\ndryest of dry bones—that circumstances are not incompatible with\\r\\nsomething like a decay in the novel: just as they were with a decay in\\r\\nthe drama. The state of society and temper in the late sixteenth and\\r\\nearly seventeenth century—not too well regulated; stirred at once by\\r\\nthe sinking force of the mediæval and the rising force of the modern\\r\\nspirit; full of religious revival which had happily not gone wholly\\r\\nwrong, as it had in some other countries; finding ready to its hand a\\r\\nlanguage which had cast most of its sloughs of accidence and prosody,\\r\\nand was fresh, limber, ready for anything; enterprising but not buried\\r\\nin business—was favourable to the rise and flourishing of this\\r\\ndisorderly abundance of dramatic creation—tragic, comic, and in all the\\r\\nvarieties that Hamlet catalogues or satirises. The mid-nineteenth\\r\\ncentury had something of the same hot-bed characteristic, though\\r\\nsufficiently contrasted and fitted to produce a different growth. It\\r\\nhad, if at a little distance, the inspiriting memory of a great war,\\r\\nwhere the country had taken the most glorious part possible. It also had\\r\\na great religious revival, which had taken no coarse or vulgar form.\\r\\nAlthough the middle class had seized, and the lower classes were\\r\\nthreatening to seize, the government, even the former had not\\r\\nmonopolised the helm. There was in society, though it was not\\r\\nstrait-laced or puritanical, a general standard of \"good form.\"\\r\\nScholarship and knowledge of literature had not yet been exchanged for\\r\\n\"education\" and ignorance of letters. The national fancy for sport was\\r\\nin about its healthiest condition, emerging from one state of\\r\\nquestionableness and not yet plunged in another. The chair of the chief\\r\\nof the kinds of literature—poetry—which always exercises a singular\\r\\ninfluence over the lower forms, was still worthily occupied and\\r\\nsurrounded. And, above all, the appetite for the novel was still eager,\\r\\nfresh, and not in the least sated, jaded, or arrived at that point when\\r\\nit has to be whetted by asafoetida on the plates or cigarettes between\\r\\nthe courses. Few better atmospheres could be even imagined for the\\r\\ncombined novel-romance—the story which, while it did not exclude the\\r\\nadventurous or even the supernatural in one sense, insisted on the\\r\\nrational in another, and opened its doors as wide as possible to every\\r\\nsubject, or combination of subjects, that would undertake to be\\r\\ninteresting. That the extraordinary reply made by genius and talent to\\r\\nthe demand thus created and encouraged should last indefinitely could\\r\\nnot be expected: that the demand itself should lead to overproduction\\r\\nand glut was certain. But, as we shall see, there was no sudden\\r\\ndecadence; the period even of best or nearly best production went on\\r\\nwith no important intermission; and was but yesterday still represented\\r\\nby two great names, is still represented by one, among the older\\r\\nwriters, by more than one or two names of credit among the middle-aged\\r\\nand younger. To these in some degree, and to those who have finished\\r\\ntheir career in the last thirty years to a greater, we must now turn.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nTHE FICTION OF YESTERDAY—CONCLUSION\\nIn regard to a large part of the subject of the present chapter the\\r\\npresent writer possesses the knowledge of a reviewer, week by week and\\r\\nalmost day by day, of contemporary fiction between 1873 and 1895. It so\\r\\nhappened that the beginning of this period coincided very nearly with\\r\\nthe beginning of that slightly downward movement of the\\r\\nnineteenth-century novel which has been referred to at the end of the\\r\\nlast chapter: and he thus had opportunities of observing it all along\\r\\nits course, till we parted company. It must again, and most strongly, be\\r\\ninsisted that this \"downward movement,\" like such movements generally in\\r\\nliterature, is only so to be characterised with considerable provisos\\r\\nand allowances. Literary \"down-grades\" are not like the slopes of an\\r\\ninclined plane: they are like portions of a mountain range, in which\\r\\nisolated peaks may shoot up almost level with the very highest of the\\r\\ncentral group, but in which the table lands are lower, the average\\r\\nheight of the hills inferior, and the general sky-line a nearer and\\r\\nnearer approximation to the plain. At the actual death of Dickens there\\r\\nwas no reason for any one less hopelessly pessimist than Peacock\\'s Mr.\\r\\nToobad, or Sydney Smith\\'s Tuxford waiter, to take a gloomy view of the\\r\\nfuture of the novel. Of the greater novelists mentioned in the last\\r\\nchapter Charlotte Brontë and Mrs. Gaskell were indeed dead, and if\\r\\nKingsley had not wholly ceased writing novels, he had, before ceasing,\\r\\ngiven signs that he had better do so. Yet, at least to the admirers of\\r\\n\"George Eliot,\" she was at her most admirable; some of the very best\\r\\nstuff of Trollope was but just past, and some of all but his best was\\r\\nstill to appear; Charles Reade was writing busily with that curious\\r\\nunsatisfactory genius of his; others were well at work.\\nThere was also no lack of newer comers. Mr. Meredith had been writing\\r\\nfor some dozen years: and though he had achieved no general popularity,\\r\\nthough even critics might make reserves as to points in his procedure,\\r\\nthere could be no competent doubt of his great powers. Mr. Blackmore had\\r\\nmade his late beginning some time before: and had just caught the public\\r\\near unmistakably with Lorna Doone (1869). Mr. Hardy was on the eve of\\r\\ncatching it with the new and powerful attractions of Under the\\r\\nGreenwood Tree (1872). In the heart of the sixties (1863-4-6), the\\r\\nChronicles of Carlingford had seemed the promissory notes of a\\r\\nnovelist of the absolutely first class in Mrs. Oliphant, though somehow\\r\\nthe bills were rather renewed than met. Others to be noticed immediately\\r\\nhad come or were coming on. Let us take a little more detailed notice of\\r\\nthem.\\nIn the cases of Mr. Meredith and of Mr. Hardy—not to speak of others on\\r\\nwhom the bar still luckily rests—the \"great ox\" was, until the original\\r\\ncomposition of this book was actually finished, \"on the tongue\" of any\\r\\none who does not disregard the good old literary brocard \"de vivis\\r\\nnil nisi necessarium.\" You may and must criticise, with as much\\r\\nfreedom as consists with courtesy, the successive stages of the work of\\r\\nthe living master as he submits it to your judgment by publication. But\\r\\njustice no less than courtesy demands that, until the work is finished,\\r\\nand sealed as a whole—till the ne varietur and ne plus ultra of\\r\\ndeath have been set on it—you shall abstain from a more general\\r\\njudgment, which can hardly be judicial, and which will have difficulty\\r\\nin steering between the fulsome if it be favourable and the uncivil if\\r\\nit be adverse. Fortunately there was little difficulty in any of our\\r\\nthree excepted cases. As has been already hinted in one case, the chorus\\r\\nof praise, ever since it made itself heard, has not been quite\\r\\nunchequered. It has been objected both to Mr. Meredith and to Mr. Hardy\\r\\nthat there is in them a note, perhaps to be detected also generally in\\r\\nthe later fiction which they have so powerfully influenced—the note of\\r\\na certain perversity—of an endeavour to be peculiar in thought, in\\r\\nstyle, in choice of subject, in handling of it; in short in general\\r\\nattitude. And with this has been connected—not in their cases with\\r\\nany important or really damaging effect, though undoubtedly so in regard\\r\\nto some of their followers—a suggestion that this \"perversity\" is the\\r\\nnote of a waning period—that just as the excessive desire to be like\\r\\nall the best models is the note of Classical decadence, so the excessive\\r\\ndesire to be unlike everything else is the note of Romantic\\r\\ndegeneration.\\nThere is truth in this, but it damages neither Mr. Meredith nor Mr.\\r\\nHardy on the whole; though it may supply a not altogether wholesome\\r\\ntemptation to some readers to admire them for the wrong things, and may\\r\\ninterpose a wholly unnecessary obstacle in the way of their full and\\r\\nfrank enjoyment by others. The intellectual power and the artistic skill\\r\\nwhich have been shown in the long series that has followed The Ordeal\\r\\nof Richard Feverel; the freshness and charm of the earlier, the\\r\\nstrenuous workmanship and original handling of the later, novels of the\\r\\nauthor of Far from the Madding Crowd and of Tess of the\\r\\nD\\'Urbervilles, simply disable off-hand the judgment of the critic—and\\r\\nin fact annul his jurisdiction—if he fails to admire them; while in\\r\\nsome cases universal, in many general, in all considerable and not\\r\\ntrivial delight has been given by them to generations of novel readers.\\r\\nAbove all, it may be said of both these veterans that they have held the\\r\\nstandard high, that—in Mr. Meredith\\'s case more specially and for a\\r\\nlonger preliminary period, but virtually in both—they have had to\\r\\nawait the taste for their work: and that in awaiting it they have never\\r\\nstooped for one moment to that dastardly and degrading change of sail to\\r\\ncatch the popular breeze, which has always been the greatest curse of\\r\\npolitics and of literature—the two chief worldly occupations and ends\\r\\nof the mind of man—that they have been and are artists who wait till\\r\\nthe world comes to them, and not artisans who haunt the market places to\\r\\nhire themselves out to the first comer who will pay their price, or even\\r\\nbate their price to suit the hirer. If it were possible to judge the\\r\\nliterary value of a period by its best representatives—which is\\r\\nexactly what is not possible—then the period 1870-1908 might, as far\\r\\nas novel-writing is concerned, point to these two names and say, \"These\\r\\nare mine; what does it matter what you choose to say against me?\"\\nThe foregoing remarks were actually written before Mr. Meredith\\'s death:\\r\\nand I have thought it better to leave them exactly as they then stood\\r\\nwith hardly any correction; but it may justly be expected that they\\r\\nshould now be supplemented. The history of Mr. Meredith\\'s career and\\r\\nreputation, during the half century which passed between the appearance\\r\\nof Richard Feverel and his death, has a certain obvious resemblance to\\r\\nthat of Browning\\'s, but with some differences. His work at once arrested\\r\\nattention, but it did not at once in all, or in many, cases fix it, even\\r\\nwith critical readers: and for a long time the general public turned an\\r\\nobstinately deaf ear. He followed The Ordeal itself—a study of very\\r\\nfreely and deeply drawn character; of incident sometimes unusual and\\r\\nalways unusually told; of elaborate and disconcerting epigram or rather\\r\\nof style saturated with epigrammatic quality; and of a strange ironic\\r\\npersiflage permeating thought, picture, and expression in the same\\r\\nway—unhastingly but unrestingly with others. Evan Harrington (1861)\\r\\nis generally lighter in tone; and should be taken in connection with the\\r\\nten years later Harry Richmond as an example of what may be called a\\r\\nsort of new picaresque novel—the subjects being exalted from the\\r\\ngutter—at least the street gutter—to higher stories of the novel\\r\\nhouse. Emilia in England (1864), later called Sandra Belloni, and\\r\\nits sequel Vittoria (1866), embody, especially the latter, the\\r\\nItalomania of the mid-century. Between them Rhoda Fleming (1865),\\r\\nreturning to English country life, showed, with the old characteristics\\r\\nof expression, tragic power superior perhaps to that of the end of\\r\\nFeverel. In fact some have been inclined to put Rhoda at the head.\\r\\nIn 1875 Beauchamp\\'s Career showed the novelist\\'s curious fancy for\\r\\nstudying off actual contemporaries; for it is now perfectly well known\\r\\nwho \"Beauchamp\" was: and four years later came what the true Meredithian\\r\\nregards as the masterpiece, The Egoist. Two other books followed, to\\r\\nsome extent in the track of Beauchamp\\'s Career, Diana of the Crossways\\r\\n(1886), utilising the legend of Mrs. Norton\\'s betrayal of secrets, and\\r\\nThe Tragic Comedians (1881), the story of the German socialist\\r\\nLassalle. The author\\'s prediction, never hurried, now slackened, and by\\r\\ndegrees ceased, but the nineties saw three books, One of Our\\r\\nConquerors (1891), Lord Ormont and his Aminta (1894), and The\\r\\nAmazing Marriage (1895).\\nNo bibliography of Mr. Meredith being here necessary or possible,\\r\\nsmaller and miscellaneous things need not detain us; and we are not\\r\\nconcerned with his sometimes charming verse. It is the character, and\\r\\nespecially the \"total-effect\" character, of the major novels with which\\r\\nwe have to do. This has been faintly adumbrated above, but the lines\\r\\nmust be a little deepened and the contour filled in to some extent here.\\nBy invoking (practically at the outset of his work) \"the Comic Spirit\"\\r\\nas the patron of his endeavours and the inspirer of his art, Mr.\\r\\nMeredith of course did no more than assert his claim to place himself in\\r\\nthe right race and lineage of Cervantes and Fielding. Nor, though the\\r\\nclaim be a bold one, can there be much dispute among competent judges\\r\\nthat he made it out. To the study, not in a frivolous or even merely\\r\\nsatirical, but in a gravely ironic mode, of the nature of humanity he\\r\\naddicted himself throughout: and the results of his studies undoubtedly\\r\\nenlarge humanity\\'s conscious knowledge of itself in the way of\\r\\nfictitious exemplification. In a certain sense no higher praise can be\\r\\ngiven. To acknowledge it is at once to estate him, not only with\\r\\nCervantes and Fielding themselves, but with Thackeray, with Swift, with\\r\\nMoliere, with Shakespeare. It places him well above Dickens, and, in the\\r\\nopinion of the present writer, it places him above even Balzac.\\r\\nBut there are points wherein, according to that same opinion, he\\r\\napproaches much nearer to Balzac and Dickens than to the other and\\r\\ngreater artistic creators: while in one of these points he stands\\r\\naloof even from these two, and occupies a position—not altogether to his\\r\\nadvantage—altogether by himself in his class of artistic creation. All\\r\\nthe six from Thackeray to Shakespeare—one might even go farther back\\r\\nand, taking a more paradoxical example, add Rabelais—are, even in\\r\\nextravaganza, in parody, in what you please, at once pre-eminently and\\r\\nprima facie natural and human. To every competent human judgment, as\\r\\nsoon as it is out of its nonage, and barring individual\\r\\ndisqualifications of property or accident, this human nature attests\\r\\nitself. You may dislike some of its manifestations; you may decline or\\r\\nfail to understand others; but there it is, and there it is first. In\\r\\nBalzac and Dickens and Mr. Meredith it is not first. Of course it is\\r\\nthere to some extent and even to a large one: or they would not be the\\r\\ngreat writers that they are, or great writers at all. But it is not\\r\\nmerely disguised by separable clothings, as in Rabelais wholly and in\\r\\nparts of others, or accompanied, as in Swift and others still, by\\r\\ncompanions not invariably acceptable. It is to a certain extent\\r\\nadulterated, sophisticated, made not so much the helpmeet, or the\\r\\nwilling handmaid, of Art as its thrall, almost its butt. I do not know\\r\\nhow early criticism, which now seems to have got hold of the fact,\\r\\nnoticed the strong connection-contrast between Dickens and Meredith: but\\r\\nit must always have been patent to some. The contrast is of course the\\r\\nfirst to strike:—the ordinariness, in spite of his fantastic grotesque,\\r\\nof Dickens, and the extraordinariness of Meredith; the almost utter\\r\\nabsence of literature in Dickens, and the prominence of it in\\r\\nMeredith—divers other differences of the same general kind. But to any\\r\\none reflecting on the matter it should soon emerge that a spirit,\\r\\nkindred in some way, but informed with literature and anxious \"to be\\r\\ndifferent,\" starting too with Dickens\\'s example before him, might, and\\r\\nprobably would, half follow, half revolt into another vein of not\\r\\nanti- but extra-natural fantasy, such as that which the author of The\\r\\nOrdeal of Richard Feverel actually worked.\\n\"Extra- not anti-\" that is the key. The worlds of Dickens, of Balzac,\\r\\nand of Meredith are not impossible worlds: for the only worlds which are\\r\\nimpossible are those which are inconsistent with themselves, and none of\\r\\nthese is that. Something has been said of the \"four dimensions\" which\\r\\nare necessary to work Dickens\\'s world, and our business here is not with\\r\\nBalzac\\'s. But something must now be said of the fourth dimension—some\\r\\nwould say the fifth, sixth, and almost tenth dimensions—which is or are\\r\\nrequired to put Mr. Meredith\\'s in working order. I do not myself think\\r\\nthat more than a fourth is needed, and I have sometimes fancied that if\\r\\nMohammedan ideas of the other world be true, and an artist is obliged to\\r\\nendow all his fictitious creations with real life, it will be by the\\r\\nreduction and elimination of this dimension that Mr. Meredith will have\\r\\nto proceed. There will be great joy in that other world when he has done\\r\\nit: and, alarming as the task looks, I think it not impudent to say that\\r\\nno one who ever enjoyed his conversation will think it impossible.\\nThe intrusive element can, however, only be designated singly by rather\\r\\nenlarging the strict and usual sense of the term Style so as to include\\r\\nnot merely diction, but the whole manner of presentation—what, in\\r\\nshort, is intended by the French word faire. For this, or part of\\r\\nthis, he made, in relation to his poems, a sort of apology-explanation\\r\\nin the lines prefixed to the collected edition, and entitled \"The\\r\\nPromise in Disturbance.\" I am not sure that there is any single place\\r\\nwhere a parallel excuse-defiance musters itself up in the novels: but\\r\\nthere are scores (the prelude to The Egoist occurs foremost) where it\\r\\nis scattered about all of them; and it is certainly much more required\\r\\nthere. Indeed as far as the narrow sense of \"style\" goes, the\\r\\npeculiarity, whether they admit it to be a fault or not, is practically\\r\\nadmitted as a fact by all but Meredith-monomaniacs. Here is a sors\\r\\nMeredithiana, taken from Rhoda Fleming, one of the simplest of the\\r\\nbooks:—\\n\"Algernon waited dinnerless until the stealthy going minutes distended\\r\\nand swelled monstrous and horrible as viper-bitten bodies, and the\\r\\nvenerable Signior Time became of unhealthy hue.\"\\nTo match that—it would be exceedingly easy to match and beat it out of\\r\\nthe author himself—you must go to the maddest of the seventeenth-century\\r\\nmetaphysicals—say to Edward Benlowes himself. But this is nothing: it is\\r\\nat worst an obvious playful exaggeration, very like some things of\\r\\nDickens\\'s own transposed into another key. But take this opening of\\r\\nthe fifteenth chapter of Diana of the Crossways:—\\n\"The Gods of this world\\'s contests, against whom our poor stripped\\r\\nindividual is commonly in revolt, are, as we know, not miners, they are\\r\\nreapers; and if we appear no longer on the surface, they cease to bruise\\r\\nus: they will allow an arena character to be cleansed and made\\r\\npresentable while enthusiastic friends preserve discretion. It is of\\r\\ncourse less than magnanimity; they are not proposed to you for your\\r\\nworship; they are little Gods, temporary as that great wave, their\\r\\nparent human mass of the hour. But they have one worshipful element in\\r\\nthem, which is, the divine insistency upon there being two sides to a\\r\\ncase—to every case. And the People so far directed by them may boast of\\r\\nhealthfulness. Let the individual shriek, the innocent, triumphant, have\\r\\nin honesty to admit the fact. One side is vanquished according to decree\\r\\nof Law, but the superior Council does not allow it to be extinguished.\"\\nHere undoubtedly there is something more than a simile, an image, or a\\r\\npointe; there is a thought, and the author\\'s admirers would, I\\r\\nsuppose, rely triumphantly on it as a marriage of original thought and\\r\\nphrase. But is it so? Is the thought really anything more than the\\r\\nperfectly correct and obvious one that, if you let scandal alone it will\\r\\ndie, or at least go into abeyance? Does that thought really gain\\r\\nanything from being tricked out with not always very congruously\\r\\narranged paraphernalia of Gods, and arenas, and reapers, and miners, and\\r\\nthe People with a large P, and shrieks, and innocency, and the rest? A\\r\\npalate or an appetite so jaded that it cannot appreciate thought put\\r\\nbefore it plainly, or so sluggish that it requires to be stung or\\r\\npuzzled into thinking, may derive some advantage. But are these exactly\\r\\nthe tastes and appetites that should be accepted as arbiters?\\nAgain, partly through this perpetual mirage and steam-cloud of style,\\r\\npartly by other methods, Mr. Meredith manages, with consummate\\r\\ncleverness no doubt, to colour his whole representation of character and\\r\\nstory in the same extra-natural way. Take the rick-burning at the\\r\\nbeginning of Feverel; take the famous wine scene (a very fascinating\\r\\none, though I never heard anywhere else, in some researches on the\\r\\nsubject, of port that would keep ninety years) in The Egoist. The\\r\\nthings may have happened this way in some Georgium Sidus, where the\\r\\nComic Spirit has arranged the proper Fourth Dimension: but that is not\\r\\nthe way they happen here. The Wise Youth, Diana, Edward Blancove, Roy\\r\\nRichmond—but why begin a list which would never end?—are inhabitants\\r\\nof the same region. They are not impossible: they could be translated\\r\\ninto actual tellurian beings, which the men and women of the bad\\r\\nnovelist never can be. But at present they are not translated: and you\\r\\nmust know a special language, in a wide sense, in order to translate\\r\\nthem. I do not say that the language is impossible or even very hard to\\r\\nlearn: but it is required. And Meredithians say you ought to learn it.\\r\\nAn extremely respectable book of reference before me rebukes \"those who\\r\\nlack the intelligence and sensibility that can alone admit them to the\\r\\ncharmed circle of appreciative readers\" and who \"have not patience to\\r\\napply themselves to the study of the higher fiction with the same ardour\\r\\nthat they think necessary in the case of any other art.\"\\nNow \"Fudge!\" is a rude word: but I fear we must borrow it from\\r\\nGoldsmith\\'s hero, and apply it here. As for \"charmed circles\" there is\\r\\nuncommonly good company outside them, where, as Beatrice says, we may\\r\\n\"be as merry as the day is long,\" so that the Comic Spirit cannot\\r\\nentirely disdain us. And as for art—the present writer will fight for\\r\\nits claims as long as he has breath. But the proof of the art of the\\r\\nnovelist is that—at first hand or very shortly—he \"enfists,\"\\r\\nabsorbs, delights you. You may discover secrets of his art afterwards\\r\\nwith much pleasure and profit: but the actual first-hand delight is the\\r\\ncriterion. There ought to be no need of sitting down before the thing\\r\\nwith tools and dynamite like burglars at a safe; of mustering crucibles\\r\\nand reagents like assayers at some doubtful and recalcitrant piece of\\r\\nore. Now these not very adept defenders of Mr. Meredith seem to assert\\r\\nthat these processes are desirable in any case, and necessary in his. As\\r\\na matter of fact the necessity is not omnipresent: but it is present far\\r\\ntoo frequently. It is the first duty of the novelist to \"let himself be\\r\\nread\"—anything else that he gives you is a bonus, a trimming, a\\r\\ndessert.\\nIt is not unamusing to those who regarded Mr. Meredith during almost his\\r\\nwhole career with those mingled feelings of the highest admiration and\\r\\nof critical reserve which this notice has endeavoured to express, to\\r\\nnote a new phase which seems to be coming over the youngest criticism.\\r\\nThe original want of appreciation has passed, never, one may hope, to\\r\\nreturn; and the middle engouement, which was mainly engineered by\\r\\nthose doughty partisans, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Henley, is passing\\r\\nlikewise. But the most competent and generous juniors seem to be a\\r\\nlittle uncomfortable, to have to take a good deal on trust, and not\\r\\nquite to \"like the security.\" To those who know the history of critical\\r\\nopinion these signs speak pretty clearly, though not so as to authorise\\r\\nthem to anticipate the final judgment absolutely. Genius, all but of the\\r\\nhighest, can hardly be denied to Mr. Meredith: but it is genius marred,\\r\\nperhaps by unfortunate education, certainly by undue egotism, by a\\r\\ncertain Celtic tapage, and by a too painful and elaborate endeavour to\\r\\nbe unlike other people.\\nA very interesting subject for examination from the present point of\\r\\nview is Mr. Blackmore, because, on the one hand there is complete\\r\\nparrhesia, and on the other (here at least) enthusiastic admiration.\\r\\nFew of our modern novelists have combined so much scholarship with so\\r\\nmuch command of mother wit and racy English, so much close study of\\r\\nminor character and local speech with such wealth of romantic fancy;\\r\\nsuch a thorough observance of \"good form\" with so complete a freedom\\r\\nfrom priggishness and prudery. To this day there are lively\\r\\ncontroversies whether he worked up the Doone story from local tradition\\r\\nor made it \"out of his own head.\" But whichever he did (and the present\\r\\nhistorian owns that he cares very little about the point) the way in\\r\\nwhich he has turned a striking, but not extraordinary, and certainly not\\r\\nvery extensive West Country glen into an Arabian Nights valley, with\\r\\nthe figures and action of a mediæval romance and the human interest of\\r\\na modern novel, is really wonderful. And there is hardly a book of his\\r\\nlast thirty years\\' production, from Clara Vaughan to Perlycross,\\r\\nwhich has not vigour, variety, character, \"race\" enough for half a\\r\\ndozen. In such books, for example, as The Maid of Sker and Cripps the\\r\\nCarrier the idiosyncrasy is extraordinary: the quaint and piquant\\r\\noddity of phrase and apophthegm is as vivid as Dickens, rather more\\r\\nreal, and tinged somehow with a flavour of literature, even of poetry,\\r\\nwhich was Dickens\\'s constant lack.\\nAnd yet when one comes to consider the books critically, either one by\\r\\none, or in pairs and batches, or as a whole, it is somehow or other\\r\\ndifficult to pronounce any one exactly a masterpiece. There is a want of\\r\\n\"inevitableness\" which sometimes amounts to improbability, as in the\\r\\ncase particularly of that most vivid and racy of books, Cripps the\\r\\nCarrier, where the central incident or situation, though by no means\\r\\nimpossible, is almost insultingly unlikely, and forces its unlikeliness\\r\\non one at almost every moment and turn. Never, perhaps, was there a\\r\\nbetter instance of that \"possible-improbable\" which contrasts so fatally\\r\\nwith the \"probable-impossible.\" In not a few cases, too, there is that\\r\\nreproduction of similar dénouements and crucial occurrences which is\\r\\nalmost necessary in a time when men write many novels. In almost all\\r\\nthere is a want of central interest in the characters that should be\\r\\ncentral; in some an exaggeration of dialect; or of quaint non-dialectic\\r\\nbut also non-catholic locutions on the author\\'s part. One rather hates\\r\\noneself for finding such faults—no one of which is absolutely fatal—in\\r\\na mass of work which has given, and continues to give, so much pleasure:\\r\\nbut the facts remain. One would not have the books not written on any\\r\\naccount; but one feels that they were written rather because the author\\r\\nchose to do so than because he could not help it. Now it is possible to\\r\\nexaggerate the necessity of \"mission\" and the like: but, after all, Ich\\r\\nkann nicht anders must be to some extent the mood of mind of the man\\r\\nwho is committing a masterpiece.\\nSomething of the sort is still more noticeable in the work of other\\r\\nwriters of the period. We have seen that two ladies of great talent,\\r\\nMrs. Oliphant and Mrs. Craik, began to write, long before Mr. Meredith\\r\\npublished Richard Feverel and very little later than the time of\\r\\nVanity Fair. They produced, the one in Salem Chapel (1863), a book\\r\\nwhich contemporaries might be excused for thinking likely to herald a\\r\\nnew George Eliot at least; the other, in John Halifax, Gentleman\\r\\n(1857), a book of more sentimentalism, but of great interest and merit.\\r\\nBoth were miracles of fecundity, Mrs. Craik producing, in the shorter\\r\\nlife of the two, not much fewer than fifty novels; Mrs. Oliphant,\\r\\nbesides a great deal of work in other departments, a tale which did not\\r\\nstop very far short of the hundred. The latter, moreover, gave, at a\\r\\ncomparatively late period of her career, evidences of being able to\\r\\nstart new lines—the supernatural stories of her last stages are only\\r\\ninferior to the Chronicles of Carlingford themselves. Yet, once more,\\r\\nwe look for a masterpiece in vain: in fact in Mrs. Oliphant\\'s case we\\r\\nask, how could any human being, on such a system of production, be\\r\\nexpected to produce masterpieces? Scott, I think, once wrote four or\\r\\nnearly four novels in a year: and the process helped to kill him. Mrs.\\r\\nOliphant did it over and over again, besides alternating the annual dose\\r\\nstill more frequently with twos and threes. In her case the process only\\r\\nkilled her novels.\\nThree remarkable novelists of the other sex may be mentioned, in the\\r\\nsame way, together. They were all acquaintances of the present writer,\\r\\nand one of them was his friend: moreover, he is quite certain that he\\r\\ncould not write as good a novel as the worst of theirs, and only takes\\r\\ncredit to himself for not having attempted to do so. These are James\\r\\nPayn, William Black, and Sir Walter Besant. Mr. Payn was an extremely\\r\\nagreeable person with a great talent for amusing, the measure of which\\r\\nhe perhaps took pretty early—consoling himself for a total absence of\\r\\nhigh pretension by a perhaps not quite genuine affectation of\\r\\ngood-natured but distinctly Philistine cynicism, and a half serious,\\r\\nhalf affected belief that other men\\'s delight in their schools, their\\r\\nuniversities, the great classics of the past, etc., was blague. He\\r\\nnever made this in the least offensive; he never made any one of his\\r\\nfifty or sixty novels anything but interesting and (when the subject\\r\\nrequired it) amusing. There never was any novelist less difficult to\\r\\nread a first time: I really do not know that it would be extremely\\r\\ndifficult to read him a second; but also I have seldom come across a\\r\\nnovelist with whom I was so little inclined to try it. It is a great\\r\\nthing, no doubt, as has been said, from a certain point of view—that of\\r\\npastime—that the reading of a novel should be easy and pleasant. But\\r\\nperhaps this is not all that you are entitled to ask of it. And as Mr.\\r\\nPayn began with Poems, and some other suggestive books, I am inclined\\r\\nto think that perhaps he did not always regard literature as a thing\\r\\nof the kind of a superior railway sandwich.\\nIt is quite certain that, in his beginning, Mr. William Black\\r\\nentertained no such idea; for his actual débuts were something like\\r\\nwhat long afterwards were called problem-novels, and In Silk Attire\\r\\n(1869), Kilmeny (1870), and the charming Daughter of Heth (1871)\\r\\nattempted a great deal besides mere amusement. It is true that no one of\\r\\nthem—not even the last—could be called an entire success: a \"little\\r\\nmore powder\" was wanted to send the shots home, and such flight as they\\r\\nachieved did not even seem to be aimed at any distinct and worthy\\r\\nobject. But fortunately for his pocket, unfortunately for his fame, he\\r\\nhit the public taste of the time with a sort of guidebook-novel in The\\r\\nStrange Adventures of a Phaeton (1872) and A Princess of Thule\\r\\n(1873), and was naturally tempted to continue it, or to branch off only\\r\\ninto not very strong stories of society. Once he made an effort at\\r\\ncombining tragic romance with this latter kind in Macleod of Dare\\r\\n(1878), but, though this was nearer to a success than some of his\\r\\ncritics admitted, it was not quite a success: and though he wrote fully\\r\\na score of novels after it, he never came nearer the actual bull\\'s eye.\\r\\nIn fact his later work was not up to a very good average.\\nNeither of these writers, except, as has been said, perhaps Black in his\\r\\nearliest stage, had taken novel-writing very seriously: it was otherwise\\r\\nwith the third of the trio. Mr., afterwards Sir Walter, Besant did not\\r\\nbegin early, owing to the fact that, for nearly a decade after leaving\\r\\nCambridge, he was a schoolmaster in Mauritius. But he had, in this time,\\r\\nacquired a greater knowledge of literature than either of the other two\\r\\npossessed: and when he came home, and took to fiction, he accompanied it\\r\\nwith, or rather based it upon, not merely wide historical studies, which\\r\\nare still bearing fruit in a series of posthumous dealings with the\\r\\nhistory of London, but rather minute observation of the lower social\\r\\nlife of the metropolis. For some ten years his novel production was\\r\\ncarried on, in a rather incomprehensible system of collaboration, with\\r\\nJames Rice, a Cambridge man like himself and a historian of the turf,\\r\\nbut one to whom no independent work in fiction is attributed, except an\\r\\nincredibly feeble adaptation of Mr. Verdant Green, entitled The\\r\\nCambridge Freshman and signed \"Martin Legrand.\" During the seventies,\\r\\nand for a year or two later, till Rice\\'s death in 1882, the pair\\r\\nprovided along series of novels from Ready-Money Mortiboy (1871) to\\r\\nThe Chaplain of the Fleet (1881), the most popular book between being,\\r\\nperhaps, The Golden Butterfly (1876). These belonged, loosely, to the\\r\\nschool of Dickens, as that school had been carried on by Wilkie Collins\\r\\n(v. inf.), but with less grotesque than the original master, and less\\r\\n\"sensation\" than the head pupil; with a good deal of solid knowledge\\r\\nboth of older and more modern life; with fairly substantial plots, good\\r\\ncharacter-drawing of the more external kind, and a sufficient supply of\\r\\ninteresting incident, dialogue, and description.\\nIt was certain that people would affect to discover a \"falling off\" when\\r\\nthe partnership was dissolved by Rice\\'s death: but as a matter of fact\\r\\nthere was nothing of the kind. Such books as the very good and original\\r\\nRevolt of Man (which certainly owed nothing to collaboration), as All\\r\\nSorts and Conditions of Men (1882), the first of the kind apparently\\r\\nthat Besant wrote alone, as Dorothy Forster (1884), and as the\\r\\npowerful if not exactly delightful Children of Gibeon (1886) were\\r\\nperhaps more vigorous than anything earlier, and certainly not less\\r\\noriginal. But the curse of the \"machine-made\" novel, which has been\\r\\nalready dwelt upon, did not quite spare Besant: and in these later\\r\\nstories critics could point, without complete unfairness, to an\\r\\nincreasing obsession of the \"London\" subject, especially in regard to\\r\\nthe actual gloom and possible illumination of the East End, and on the\\r\\nother to a resort to historical subjects, less as suggestions or\\r\\ncanvases than as giving the substance of the book. The first class of\\r\\nwork, however (which actually resulted in a \"People\\'s Palace\" and was\\r\\nsupposed to have obtained his knighthood for him), is distinctly\\r\\nremarkable, especially in the light of succeeding events. Most of the\\r\\nunfavourable criticisms passed upon Besant\\'s novel-work were in the main\\r\\nthe utterances of raw reviewers, who thought it necessary to \"down\"\\r\\nestablished reputations. But it would be impossible for any competent\\r\\ncritic, however much he might be biassed off the bench by friendship,\\r\\nnot to admit, on it, that he also shows the effect, which we have been\\r\\nillustrating from others, of the system of novel-production à la\\r\\ndouzaine. In such a case, and on the, in themselves, salutary\\r\\nconditions of the new novel, the experiences and interests of life may\\r\\nor must come to be regarded too regularly as supplying \"grist for the\\r\\nmill\"; nay, the whole of life and literature, which no doubt ought in\\r\\nall cases to furnish suggestion and help to art and inspiration, are too\\r\\noften set to a sort of corvèe, a day-task, a tale of bricks. It is,\\r\\none allows, hard to prevent this: and yet nothing is more certain that\\r\\nbricks so made are not the best material to be wrought into any really\\r\\n\"star-y-pointing pyramid\" that shall defy the operations of time.\\nA very curious and characteristic member of this group, Wilkie Collins,\\r\\nhas not yet been mentioned except by glances. He was a little older than\\r\\nmost of them, and came pretty early under the influence of Dickens,\\r\\nwhose melodramatic rather than his humorous side he set himself to work\\r\\nto develop. In fact Collins was at least as much melodramatist as\\r\\nnovelist: and while most of his novels are melodrama in narrative form,\\r\\nnot a few of them were actually dramatised. He began as early as\\r\\n1850—the dividing year—with Antonina: but his three great triumphs\\r\\nin the \"sensation\" novel (as it was rather stupidly called) were The\\r\\nDead Secret (1857), The Woman in White (1860), and No Name (1862).\\r\\nThroughout the sixties and a little later, in Armadale (1866), The\\r\\nMoonstone (1870), perhaps The New Magdalen (1873), and even as late\\r\\nas 1875 in The Law and the Lady, his work continued to be eagerly\\r\\nread. But the taste for it waned: and its author\\'s last fifteen years or\\r\\nso (he died in 1889), though fairly fruitful in quantity, certainly did\\r\\nnot tend to keep it up in quality. Although Collins had a considerable\\r\\namount of rather coarse vigour in him (his brother Charles, who died\\r\\nyoung, had a much more delicate art) and great fecundity in a certain\\r\\nkind of stagy invention, it is hard to believe that his work will ever\\r\\nbe put permanently high. It has a certain resemblance in method to\\r\\nGodwin and Mrs. Radcliffe, exciting situations being arranged, certainly\\r\\nwith great cleverness, in an interminable sequence, and leading,\\r\\nsometimes at any rate, to a violent \"revolution\" (in the old dramatic\\r\\nsense) at the end. Perhaps the best example is the way in which Magdalen\\r\\nVanstone\\'s desperate and unscrupulous, though more than half\\r\\njustifiable, machinations, to reverse the cruel legal accident which\\r\\nleaves her and her sister with \"No Name\" and no fortune, are foiled by\\r\\nthe course of events, though the family property is actually recovered\\r\\nfor this sister who has been equally guiltless and inactive. Of its\\r\\nkind, the machinery is as cleverly built and worked as that of any novel\\r\\nin the world: but while the author has given us some Dickensish\\r\\ncharacter-parts of no little attraction (such as the agreeable rascal\\r\\nCaptain Wragge) and has nearly made us sympathise strongly with Magdalen\\r\\nherself, he only succeeds in this latter point so far as to make us\\r\\nangry with him for his prudish poetical or theatrical justice, which is\\r\\nnot poetical and hardly even just.\\nThe specialist or particularist novel was not likely to be without\\r\\npractitioners during this time: in fact it might be said, after a\\r\\nfashion, to be more rife than ever: but it can only be glanced at here.\\r\\nIts most remarkable representatives perhaps—men, however, of very\\r\\ndifferent tastes and abilities—were Richard Jefferies and Joseph Henry\\r\\nShorthouse. The latter, after attracting very wide attraction by a\\r\\nremarkable book—almost a kind to itself—John Inglesant (1880), a\\r\\nhalf historical, half ecclesiastical novel of seventeenth-century life,\\r\\nnever did anything else that was any good at all, and indeed tried\\r\\nlittle. The former, a struggling country journalist, after long failing\\r\\nto make any way, wrote several three-volume novels of no merit, broke\\r\\nthrough at last in the Pall Mall Gazette with a series of studies of\\r\\ncountry life, The Gatekeeper at Home (1878), and afterwards turned\\r\\nthese into a peculiar style of novel, with little story and hardly any\\r\\ncharacter, but furnished with the backgrounds and the atmosphere of\\r\\nthese same sketches. His health was weak, and he died in early middle\\r\\nage, leaving a problem of a character exactly opposed to the other.\\r\\nWould Mr. Shorthouse, if he had not been a well-to-do man of business,\\r\\nbut obliged to write for his living, have done more and better work?\\r\\nWould Jefferies, if he had been more fortunate in education, occupation,\\r\\nand means, and furnished with better health, have co-ordinated and\\r\\nexpanded his certainly rare powers into something more \"important\" than\\r\\nthe few pictures, as of a Meissonier-paysagiste, which he has left us?\\r\\nThese inquiries are no doubt idle: but, once more, one may draw\\r\\nattention to the way in which two men, so different in tastes and\\r\\nfortune, neither, it would seem, with a very strong bent towards prose\\r\\nfiction as the vehicle of his literary desires and accomplishments,\\r\\nappear to have been forced, by the overpowering attraction and\\r\\npopularity of the kind, to adopt the novel as their form of literature,\\r\\nand to give the public, not what they wanted in the form which they\\r\\nchose, but something at least made up in the form that the public\\r\\nwanted, and disguised in the wrappers which the public were accustomed\\r\\nto purchase.\\nThe principal development of mid-nineteenth-century fiction had been, as\\r\\nwe have seen, in the direction of the novel proper—the\\r\\ncharacter-study of modern ordinary life. But, even as early as Esmond\\r\\nand Hypatia, signs were not wanting that the romance, historical or\\r\\nother, was not going to be content with the rather pale copies of Scott,\\r\\nand the rococo-sentimental style of Bulwer, which had mainly occupied it\\r\\nfor the last quarter of a century. Still, though we have mentioned other\\r\\nexamples of the fifties and sixties, and have left ever so many more\\r\\nunmentioned, it was certainly not as popular27 as its rival till,\\r\\ntowards the end of the latter decade, Mr. Blackmore\\'s Lorna Doone gave\\r\\nit a fresh hold on the public taste. Some ten years later again there\\r\\ncame to its aid a new recruit of very exceptional character, Mr. Robert\\r\\nLouis Stevenson. He was a member of the famous family of light-house\\r\\nengineers, and was educated for the Bar of Scotland, to which he was\\r\\nactually called. But law was as little to his taste as engineering, and\\r\\nhe slowly gravitated towards literature—the slowness being due, not\\r\\nmerely to family opposition or to any other of the usual causes (though\\r\\nsome of these were at work), but to an intense and elaborate desire to\\r\\nwork himself out a style of his own by the process of \"sedulously aping\"\\r\\nothers. It may be very much doubted whether this process ever gave any\\r\\none a style of perfect freedom: and it may be questioned further whether\\r\\nStevenson ever attained such a style.\\nBut there could be no question that he did attain very interesting and\\r\\nartistic effects, and there happened to be at the time a reaction\\r\\nagainst what was called \"slovenliness\" and a demand for careful\\r\\npreparation and planned effect in prose-writing. Even so, however, it\\r\\nwas not at once that Stevenson took to fiction. He began with essays,\\r\\nliterary and miscellaneous, and with personal accounts of travel: and\\r\\ncertain critical friends of his strongly urged him to continue in this\\r\\nway. During the years 1878 and 1879, in a short-lived periodical called\\r\\nLondon, which came to be edited by his friend the late Mr. Henley and\\r\\nhad a very small staff, he issued certain New Arabian Nights which\\r\\ncaught the attention of one or two of his fellow-contributors very\\r\\nstrongly, and made them certain that a new power in fiction-writing had\\r\\narisen. It did not, however, at first much attract the public: and it\\r\\nwas the kind of thing which never attracts publishers until the public\\r\\nforces their hands. For a time he had to wait, and to take what\\r\\nopportunity he could get of periodical publication, \"boy\\'s\\r\\nbook\"-writing, and the like. In fact Treasure Island (1883), with\\r\\nwhich he at last made his mark, is to this day classed as a boy\\'s book\\r\\nby some people who are miserable if they cannot classify. It certainly\\r\\ndeals with pirates, and pieces of eight, and adventures by land and sea;\\r\\nbut the manner of dealing—the style and narrative and the delineation\\r\\nof the chief character, the engaging villain John Silver—is about as\\r\\nlittle puerile as anything that can be imagined. From that time\\r\\nStevenson\\'s reputation was assured. Ill health, a somewhat restless\\r\\ndisposition, and an early death prevented him from accomplishing any\\r\\ngreat bulk of work: and the merit of what he did varied. Latterly he\\r\\ntook to a teasing process of collaboration, which his sincerest admirers\\r\\ncould have willingly spared. But his last completed book, Catriona\\r\\n(1893), seemed to some judges of at least considerable experience the\\r\\nbest thing he had yet done, especially in one all-important\\r\\nrespect—that he here conquered either an unwillingness to attempt or an\\r\\ninability to achieve the portraiture of feminine character, which his\\r\\nbooks had previously displayed. The general opinion, too, was that the\\r\\nunfinished Weir of Hermiston (1897), which he left a fragment at his\\r\\ndeath, was the best and strongest thing he had done, while it showed in\\r\\nparticular a distinct relinquishment, for something freer and more\\r\\nspontaneous, of the effective but also rather affected and decidedly\\r\\nlaboured style in which he had hitherto written. For us, however, his\\r\\nstyle is of less importance than the fact that he applied it almost\\r\\nwholly to the carrying out of that rejuvenescence of romance of which we\\r\\nhave been speaking, and which may be taken, as anybody pleases, either\\r\\nfor a mere alternative to the domestic novel or as a definite revolt\\r\\nagainst it. It was speedily taken up by writers mostly still living, and\\r\\nso not to be dwelt on now.\\nVery late in the century the genius of Mr. William Morris turned from\\r\\nverse to prose tale-telling in a series of romances which caught the\\r\\nfancy neither of the public nor of the critics as a whole, but which\\r\\nseem to some whom the gods have made not quite uncritical to be, if\\r\\nrightly taken, of much accomplishment, and of almost more promise and\\r\\nsuggestion. These, seven or eight in number, from The House of the\\r\\nWulfings (1889) to The Sundering Flood, published after the author\\'s\\r\\ndeath in 1898, were actual romances—written in a kind of modernised\\r\\nfifteenth-century English, and dealing, some with far back incidents of\\r\\nthe conflict between Romans and \"Barbarians,\" most with the frank\\r\\nno-time and no-place of Romance itself. They came at an unfortunate\\r\\nmoment, when the younger generation of readers were thinking it proper\\r\\nto be besotted with crude realism or story-less impressionism, and when\\r\\nsome at least of those who might have welcomed them earlier had left\\r\\ntheir first faith in poetry or poetic prose. There was, moreover,\\r\\nperhaps some genuine dislike, and certainly a good deal of precisian\\r\\ncondemnation, of the \"Wardour Street\" dialect. Yet there was no sham in\\r\\nthem: it was impossible for Mr. Morris to have anything to do with\\r\\nshams—even his socialism was not that—and they were in reality a\\r\\nrevival, however Rip van Winklish it might seem, of the pure old romance\\r\\nitself, at the hands of a nineteenth-century sorcerer, who no doubt put\\r\\na little of the nineteenth century into them. The best—probably the\\r\\nbest of all is The Well at the World\\'s End (1896)—have an\\r\\nextraordinary charm for any one who can taste romance: and are by no\\r\\nmeans unlikely to awake the taste for it in generations to come. But for\\r\\nthe present the thing lay out of the way of its generation, and was not\\r\\ncomprehended or enjoyed thereby. For it is no doubt nearly as annoying\\r\\nto have bread given to you when you want thistles as to have thistles\\r\\ngiven to you when you want bread. But just as the ballad is the\\r\\nappointed reviver of poetry, so is romance the appointed reviver of\\r\\nprose-fiction: and in one form or another it will surely do its work,\\r\\nsooner or later.\\nHere it may be best to stop the actual current of critical comment on\\r\\nindividuals. Something has been hinted as to the general present\\r\\ncondition of the novel, but there is no need to emphasise it or to enter\\r\\ninto particulars about it: indeed, even if such a proceeding were\\r\\nconvenient in one way it would be very inconvenient in another. One\\r\\nmight, for instance, have to consider, rather curiously, a remarkable\\r\\nstatement recently attributed to a popular novelist that \"the general\\r\\nstandard of excellence in fiction is higher to-day than ever it was\\r\\nbefore.\" But we can take higher ground. Far be it from me to bow to the\\r\\nBaal of \"up-to-dateness,\" for even if I had any such hankering, I think\\r\\nI should remember that the surest way of being out-of-date to-morrow is\\r\\nthe endeavour to be up-to-date to-day. Only by keeping perspective can\\r\\nyou hope to confirm and steady your view: only by relinquishing the\\r\\nimpossible attempt to be complete can you achieve a relative\\r\\ncompleteness.\\nYet it is well to remember that Lockhart, one of the best critics who\\r\\never lived (when he let himself be so), a novelist too, and not likely\\r\\nto lose an opportunity of magnifying his office if he could, took\\r\\noccasion, in noticing the novels of his friend Theodore Hook at poor\\r\\n\"Mr. Wagg\\'s\" death, gravely to deplore the decadence of the novel\\r\\ngenerally: and not much later, in reprinting the article, had the wisdom\\r\\nto recognise, and the courage to record, the fact that Thackeray had\\r\\ndisappointed his prognostications. Literature, it has been said, is the\\r\\nincalculable of incalculables: and not only may a new novelist arise\\r\\nto-morrow, but some novelist who has been writing for almost any number\\r\\nof years may change his style, strike the vein, and begin the\\r\\nexploitation of a new gold-field in novel-production.\\nBut this does not affect the retrospect of the past. There we are on\\r\\nperfectly firm ground—ground which we have traversed carefully already,\\r\\nand which we may survey in surety now.\\nWe have seen, then, that the prose novel—a late growth both in ancient\\r\\nand in modern times in all countries—was a specially late and\\r\\nslow-yielding one in English. Although Thoms\\'s Early English Prose\\r\\nRomances is by no means an exhaustive collection, and for this reason\\r\\nwas not specially referred to in the first chapter, it is impossible not\\r\\nto recognise that its three rather small volumes, of matter for the most\\r\\npart exceeding poor and beggarly, contrast in the most pitiful fashion\\r\\nwith the scores and almost hundreds containing Early English Romances in\\r\\nverse. Malory of course brings the prose-scale down very considerably\\r\\nfrom its uncomfortably meteoric position, and some other things help:\\r\\nbut the total of prose and verse before 1500 can be brought level by no\\r\\npossible sleight of weighing. Still, as we have seen, this did not\\r\\nmatter very much: for the verse got \"transprosed\" sooner or later, and\\r\\nthe romances and tales of other countries were greedily admitted ad\\r\\neundem in sixteenth and seventeenth century English.\\nYet the novel proper lingered: and, except in the single and eccentric\\r\\nmasterpiece of Bunyan, the seventeenth century ended without having seen\\r\\none real specimen of prose fiction that was thoroughly satisfactory.\\r\\nNearly half the eighteenth had gone too, with nothing but the less\\r\\nisolated but still not perfect performances of Defoe, and the once more\\r\\nstill eccentric masterpiece of Gulliver, before the novel-period\\r\\nreally opened. It is literally not more than two long lifetimes ago—it\\r\\nis quite certain that there are now living hundreds, perhaps thousands,\\r\\nof persons born when others were still living who drew their first\\r\\nbreaths in or before the year when Pamela made her modest, but very\\r\\ndistinctly self-conscious, curtsey to the world. How soon it grew to a\\r\\npopular form of literature, and how steadily that popularity has\\r\\ncontinued and increased, there is not much need to say or to repeat.\\r\\nStatistical persons every year give us the hundreds of novels that\\r\\nappear from the presses, and the thousands of readers who take them out\\r\\nof, or read them in, public libraries. I do not know whether there\\r\\nexists anywhere a record of the total number published since 1740, but I\\r\\ndare say it does. I should not at all wonder if this total ran into\\r\\nscores of thousands: if you were to bring in short stories it would\\r\\ncertainly do so. People have almost left off shaking their heads over\\r\\nthe preponderant or exclusive attention to fiction in these public\\r\\nlibraries themselves: in fact the tendency seems to be rather to make\\r\\nout that it is decreasing. It may be so; or it may not. But what remains\\r\\ncertain is that there is a very large number of educated people to whom\\r\\n\"reading\" simply means reading novels; who never think of taking up a\\r\\nbook that is not a novel; for whom the novel exhausts even the very\\r\\nmeaning of the word \"literature.\" We know that the romance was\\r\\noriginally so called simply because it was the commonest book in\\r\\n\"Romance\" language. We are less unsophisticated now: but there are\\r\\ncertainly large numbers of His Majesty\\'s subjects by whom a novel on\\r\\nthis principle ought to be called \"an english\" though it might have to\\r\\nshare that appellation with the newspaper.\\nYet, as we have seen, for this or that reason, the average novel did\\r\\nnot come to anything like perfection for a very long time. In a single\\r\\nexample, or set of examples, it reached something like perfection almost\\r\\nat once. Fielding, Scott, Miss Austen, and Thackeray are the Four\\r\\nMasters of the whole subject, giving the lady the same degree as the\\r\\nothers by courtesy of letters. But in the first (as for the matter of\\r\\nthat in the last) of the four the success was rather a matter of\\r\\nindividual and inimitable genius than of systematic discovery of method\\r\\npracticable by others. Nobody, except Thackeray himself, has ever\\r\\nfollowed Fielding successfully, and that only in parts and touches; as\\r\\nFielding had (unfortunately) no opportunity of following Thackeray, no\\r\\none has ever followed Thackeray satisfactorily at all. Such reasons as\\r\\npresented themselves have been given for the fact that nearly half of\\r\\nthe whole period passed before the two systems—of the pure novel and\\r\\nthe novel-romance—were discovered: and even then they were not at once\\r\\nput to work. But the present writer would be the very first to confess\\r\\nthat these explanations leave a great deal unexplained.\\nYet whatever faults there might be in the supply there could be no doubt\\r\\nabout the demand when it was once started. It was indeed almost entirely\\r\\nindependent of the goodness or badness of the average supply itself.\\r\\nAllowing for the smaller population and the much smaller proportion of\\r\\nthat population who were likely to—who indeed could—read, and for the\\r\\ninferior means of distribution, it may be doubted whether the largest\\r\\nsales of novels recorded in the last half century have surpassed those\\r\\nof the most trumpery trash of the \"Minerva Press\" period—the last\\r\\ndecade of the eighteenth and the first of the nineteenth century. For\\r\\nthe main novel-public is quite omnivorous, and almost absolutely\\r\\nuncritical of what it devours. The admirable though certainly fortunate\\r\\nScot who \"could never remember drinking bad whisky\" might be echoed, if\\r\\nthey had the wit, by not a few persons who never seem to read a bad\\r\\nnovel, or at least to be aware that they are reading one.\\nAt the same time, the failure of the quest for novel-recipes was\\r\\ncompensated by an absence of that working of those recipes to death\\r\\nwhich the last century—or the last three-quarters of it—has seen. The\\r\\naverage work of any one of a dozen nineteenth-century producers of\\r\\nnovels by the dozen and the score, whom at this place it is not\\r\\nnecessary to name, is probably on the whole a much better turned out\\r\\nthing—one better observing its own purposes, and open to less criticism\\r\\nin detail—than even the best of the works of the earlier division\\r\\noutside of Fielding. But the eighteenth-century books—faulty, only\\r\\npartially satisfying as they may be in comparison, say, with a\\r\\nwell-succeeded Trollope or one of the better Blackmores—very often have\\r\\na certain idiosyncrasy, a freedom from machine-work, which supplies\\r\\nsomething not altogether unlike the contrast between the furniture of\\r\\nthe two periods. Stress and dwelling have been purposely given, to some\\r\\nminor books of this period, for this very reason.\\nBut at the same time the limitations, outside the greatest, are\\r\\ncertainly peculiar. It seems wonderful that a man like Cumberland, for\\r\\ninstance, who had not a little literary talent, should not have been\\r\\nable to make Henry into a story of real interest that might hold the\\r\\nreader as even second-class Trollope—say a book like Orley\\r\\nFarm—does. We have ungraciously recognised that some of our lady\\r\\nnovelists, who wrote by forties and by fifties, did not always sustain\\r\\nthe interest of their novels. Miss Burney wrote four in all, and could\\r\\nhardly keep up the interest of hers right through the second. Above all,\\r\\nthere is the difficulty of their failure with conversation and, in fact,\\r\\nwith any diction proper for conversation. If Horace Walpole, a\\r\\ncontemporary of the eighteenth-century novel from its actual start to\\r\\npractically its finish, could give us thousands and all but tens of\\r\\nthousands of phrases that want but a little of being novel-conversation\\r\\nready made, why could not the other people make it for their own\\r\\npurposes? But we have got no answer to these questions: and probably\\r\\nthere is none.\\nThe way in which Scott and Miss Austen themselves simultaneously found\\r\\nout the secrets of the two kinds of novel is no doubt, as such ways\\r\\nalways are, in the larger part mysterious: but to a certain extent it\\r\\ncan be explained and analysed, independently of the direct literary\\r\\ngenius of each. One of the greatest gifts of Scott—one with which the\\r\\nnon-historical novelist can dispense as little as his brother the\\r\\nhistorical—was that \"genius of history\" with which Lord Morley—a\\r\\ncritic not likely to be misled by sympathy in some respects at any\\r\\nrate—has justly credited him. For unless you have this \"historic\\r\\nsense,\" as it has been more generally and perhaps better termed (though\\r\\nto the intense disgust of some professed historians), it is not only\\r\\nimpossible for you to delineate scene and character at a distance from\\r\\nyour time, but you become really disqualified for depicting your own\\r\\ntime itself. You fail to distinguish the temporary from the permanent;\\r\\nyou achieve perhaps a fairly faithful copy of actual manners and\\r\\nfashions, but you do nothing more, and as the subject dies so does the\\r\\npicture. Contrast Hook, say, with Thackeray, and the difference will\\r\\nemerge at once.\\nSecondly, Scott had, besides this historic sense and the relish for\\r\\nhumanity which must accompany it, a knowledge of literature with which\\r\\nhe has been too seldom credited to the full. When he published\\r\\nWaverley he had been reading all sorts and conditions of books for\\r\\nsome five-and-thirty years, and assimilating them if, as the pedants\\r\\nwill have it, with a distressing inaccuracy in particulars, with a\\r\\ngeneral and genial fidelity of which the pedants do not even dream and\\r\\ncould not comprehend, or they would not be pedants. He was thus\\r\\nfurnished with infinite stores of illustrative matter, never to\\r\\noverpower, but always to accompany and season, his knowledge of life. In\\r\\na few instances this felicity of adoption has been recognised, but not a\\r\\ntenth part of it has ever been systematically put on record. The more\\r\\nwidely and the longer a man reads, the more constantly will he find that\\r\\nScott has been before him, and has \"lifted\" just the touch that he\\r\\nwanted at the time and in the place.\\nBut perhaps a greater gift (there were still others which it would be\\r\\nlong to perscribe—descriptive faculty, humour, pathos, half a dozen\\r\\nother things of the highest importance in themselves, but of less\\r\\nspecial application) was that which enabled him to discover and apply\\r\\nsomething like a universal novel language. He did this, not as\\r\\nShakespeare did (and as nobody but Shakespeare, except perhaps Dante to\\r\\nsome extent, ever has done or apparently could do), by making a really\\r\\nuniversal language which fits all times and persons because it is\\r\\nuniversal like its creator\\'s soul. Still less did he do it by adopting\\r\\nthe method which Spenser did consummately, but which almost everybody\\r\\nelse has justified Ben Jonson by doing very badly:—that is to say by\\r\\nconstructing a mosaic of his own. But his own method was nearer to this\\r\\nlatter. For historical creations (the most important of his\\r\\nnon-historic, Guy Mannering and the Antiquary, were so near his own\\r\\ntime that he had no difficulty) he threw back with remarkable cunning to\\r\\na period somewhat earlier, and coloured this up to the required tint by\\r\\nactual suggestions from contemporary, or nearly contemporary,\\r\\nliterature, where he could get it. He has done this so consummately that\\r\\nperhaps the only novel of his where the language strikes us as\\r\\nartificial is the single one in which he actually endeavoured to be\\r\\n\"up-to-date\"—St. Ronan\\'s Well.\\nThis question of \"Lingo,\" on the other hand, was Miss Austen\\'s weakest\\r\\npoint: and we have seen and shall see that it continued to be a weak\\r\\npoint with others. Some admirers have defended her even here: but proud\\r\\nas I am to be an Austen Friar, a knight (or at least squire) of the\\r\\norder of St. Jane, I cannot go to this length. She very nearly\\r\\nsucceeded, and sometimes she did quite: but not always. The easy\\r\\ndialogue and phrase that we find as early as Horace Walpole, even as\\r\\nChesterfield and Lady Mary, in letters; which, in her own early days,\\r\\nappears in Fanny Burney\\'s diaries but not in the novels, does not seem\\r\\nalways within Miss Austen\\'s grasp. But her advance in this respect is\\r\\nenormous: she is, for instance, far beyond Scott himself in St. Ronan\\'s\\r\\nWell: and when she is thoroughly interested in a character, and engaged\\r\\nin unfolding it and gently satirising it at the same time, she rarely\\r\\ngoes even a hair\\'s-breadth wrong. In almost every other respect she does\\r\\nnot go wrong to the extent of the minutest section of a hair. The story\\r\\nis the least part with her: but her stories are always miraculously\\r\\nadequate: neither desultory and pillar-to-post, nor elaborated with\\r\\nthe minuteness which seems to please some people, but which is quite\\r\\nindifferent to the majority, and is certainly a positive nuisance to a\\r\\nfew who are not quite of negligible judgment. But the reason of this\\r\\nadequacy in story contains in itself her greatest triumph. Not being a\\r\\npoet, she cannot reach the Shakespearian consummateness of poetic\\r\\nphrase: though she sometimes comes not so far short of this in the prose\\r\\nvariety. But in the other great province of character, though hers is\\r\\nbut a Rutland to his Yorkshire—or rather to his England or his\\r\\nworld—she is almost equally supreme. And by her manipulation of it she\\r\\nshowed, once for all, how the most ordinary set of circumstances, and\\r\\neven the most ordinary characters in a certain sense, can be made to\\r\\nsupply the material of prose fiction to an absolutely illimitable\\r\\nextent. Her philosopher\\'s stone (to take up the old parable again) does\\r\\nnot lose its powers even when all the metal in the house is\\r\\nexhausted—if indeed the metal, or anything else, in the House of\\r\\nHumanity were exhaustible. The chairs and tables, the beds and the\\r\\nbasins—everything—can be made into novel-gold: and, when it has been\\r\\nmade, it remains as useful for future conversion, by the same or any\\r\\nother magician of the same class, as ever. One of the most curious\\r\\nthings about Miss Austen is the entire absence of self-repetition in\\r\\nher. Even her young men—certainly not her greatest successes—are by no\\r\\nmeans doubles of each other: and nature herself could not turn out half\\r\\na dozen girls more subtly and yet more sufficiently differentiated than\\r\\nCatherine and Elizabeth, Marianne and Fanny, Elinor and Emma, and\\r\\nfinally the three sisters of Persuasion, the other (quite other)\\r\\nElizabeth, Mary, and Anne. The \"ruts of the brain\" in novelists are a\\r\\nby-word. There are none here.\\nIn these two great writers of English novel there is, really for the\\r\\nfirst time, the complementary antithesis after which people have often\\r\\ngone (I fear it must be said) wool-gathering elsewhere. The amateurs of\\r\\ncosmopolitan literature, I believe, like to find it in Stendhal and\\r\\nMichelet. They praise the former for his delicate and pitiless\\r\\npsychological analysis. It had been anticipated a dozen years, nay,\\r\\nnearly twenty years, before he saw the Beresina: and was being given out\\r\\nin print at about the very moment of that uncomfortable experience, and\\r\\nbefore he himself published anything, by a young English lady—a lady if\\r\\never there was one and English if any person ever was—in a country\\r\\nparsonage in Hampshire or in hired houses, quite humdrum and commonplace\\r\\nto the commonplace and humdrum imagination, at Bath and Southampton.\\r\\nThey praise Michelet for his enthusiastic and multiform apprehension of\\r\\nthe plastic reality of the past, his re-creation of it, his putting of\\r\\nit, live and active, before the present. The thing had been done, twenty\\r\\nyears earlier again, by a Scotch advocate who had deliberately turned\\r\\nfrom poetic form, though he retained poetic imagination, and who did not\\r\\ndisdain not to make a fool of himself, as Michelet, with all his genius,\\r\\ndid again and again. Of all the essentials of the two manners of\\r\\nfictitious creation—Michelet\\'s was not fictitious, but he almost made\\r\\nit so, and Stendhal\\'s was not historical, but he almost made it so\\r\\nlikewise—Scott and Miss Austen had set the types, given the methods,\\r\\narranged the processes as definitely as Fust, or Coster, or Gutenberg,\\r\\nor Fust\\'s friend Mephistopheles—who perhaps, on the whole, has the best\\r\\ntitle to the invention—did in another matter three hundred years\\r\\nbefore.\\nThat Scott\\'s variety should be taken up first, and should for a time\\r\\nhave the great popularity, the greater number of disciples, the greater\\r\\nacceptance as a mode of pleasing—was, as has been pointed out, natural\\r\\nenough; it is not a little significant that (to avert our eyes from\\r\\nEngland) the next practitioner of the psychological style in European\\r\\nliterature, Balzac, went through a long and mostly unsuccessful\\r\\nprobation in the other kind, and never wholly deserted it, or at least\\r\\nalways kept looking back to it. But the general shortcomings (as they\\r\\nhave been admitted to be) in the whole of the second quarter of the\\r\\ncentury (or a little less) with us, were but natural results of the\\r\\ninevitable expatiation, unsystematic and irresolute, over the newly\\r\\ndiscovered provinces. And they gave admirable work of various\\r\\nkinds—work especially admirable if we remember that there was no\\r\\ngeneral literary uprising with us as there was, in France and elsewhere,\\r\\nabout 1830. If it were in any way possible—similar supposings have been\\r\\nadmitted in literature very often—it would be extremely interesting to\\r\\ntake a person ex hypothesi fairly acquainted with the rest of\\r\\nliterature—English, foreign, European, and classical—but who knew\\r\\nnothing and had heard nothing of Bulwer, Disraeli, Peacock, Marryat,\\r\\neven Ainsworth and James and others between Scott and the accomplished\\r\\nwork of Thackeray (Dickens\\'s is, as has been said, mainly a sport of\\r\\ngenius), and to turn him loose on this work. I do him the justice to\\r\\nsuppose that he would find not a few faults: I shall also do him the\\r\\njustice to think it likely that he (being, as said, ex hypothesi\\r\\nfurnished with the miscellaneous knowledge necessary to enjoy them)\\r\\nwould enjoy them very keenly and thoroughly. If you added the minorities\\r\\nof the time, such as that very clever Miss Robinson (I think her name\\r\\nwas Emma) who wrote Whitefriars and other historical romances in the\\r\\nforties; such as Charles Macfarlane, who died, like Colonel Newcome, a\\r\\npoor brother of the Charterhouse after writing capital things like The\\r\\nDutch in the Medway and The Camp of Refuge—if, I say, you gave him\\r\\nthese things and he was a good man, but lazy, like Gray, I think he\\r\\nwould vote for a continuance of his life of novels and sofas without\\r\\nsighing for anything further. But undoubtedly it might be contended that\\r\\nsomething further was needed: and it came. This was verisimilitude—the\\r\\nholding of the true mirror to actual society.\\nThis verisimilitude, it should be observed, is not only difficult to\\r\\nattain: it seems not to be easy even to recognise. I have seen it said\\r\\nthat the reason which makes it \"hopeless for many people even to try to\\r\\nget through Pickwick\" (their state itself must be \"hopeless\" enough,\\r\\nand it is to be hoped there are not \"many\" of them) is that it\\r\\n\"describes states of society unimaginable to many people of to-day.\"\\r\\nAgain, these many people must be somewhat unimaginative. But that is not\\r\\nthe point of the matter. The point is that Dickens depicts no \"state of\\r\\nsociety\" that ever existed, except in the Dickensium Sidus. What he\\r\\ngives is full of intensely real touches which help to create its charm.\\r\\nBut it is difficult to say that there is even a single person in it who\\r\\nis real as a whole, in the sense of having possibly existed in this\\r\\nworld: and the larger whole of the book generally is pure fantasy—as\\r\\nmuch so as one of the author\\'s own favourite goblin-dream stories.\\nWith Thackeray the case is exactly the opposite. It is a testimony no\\r\\ndoubt to Dickens\\'s real power—though perhaps not to his readers\\'\\r\\nperspicacity—that he made them believe that he intended a \"state of\\r\\nsociety\" when, whether he intended it or not, he certainly has not given\\r\\nit. But Thackeray intended it and gave it. His is a \"state of society\"\\r\\nalways—whether in late seventeenth century, early or late eighteenth,\\r\\nearly or middle nineteenth—which existed or might have existed; his\\r\\npersons are persons who lived or might have lived. And it is the\\r\\ndiscovery of this art of creation by him and its parallel diffusion\\r\\namong his contemporaries that I am endeavouring to make clear here.\\r\\nFielding, Scott to some extent, Miss Austen had had it. Dickens, till\\r\\nGreat Expectations at least, never achieved and I believe never\\r\\nattempted it. Bulwer, having failed in it for twenty years, struck it at\\r\\nlast about this time, and so did, even before him, Mrs. Marsh, and\\r\\nperhaps others, falteringly and incompletely. But as a general gift—a\\r\\ncharacteristic—it never distinguished novelists till after the middle\\r\\nof the century.\\nIt is, I think, impossible to find a better meeting and overlapping\\r\\nplace of the old and the new novel, than that very remarkable book\\r\\nEmilia Wyndham, which has been already more than once referred to. It\\r\\nwas written in 1845 and appeared next year—the year of Vanity Fair.\\r\\nBut the author was twenty years older than Thackeray, though she\\r\\nsurvived him by nearly a dozen; she had not begun early; and she was\\r\\nfifty-five when she wrote Emilia. The not unnatural consequence is\\r\\nthat there is a great deal of inconsistency in the general texture of\\r\\nthe book: and that any clever cub, in the \\'prentice stage of reviewing,\\r\\ncould make columns of fun out of it. The general theme is age-old, being\\r\\nnot different from the themes of most other novels in that respect. A\\r\\nhalf-idiotic spendthrift (he ends as very nearly an actual idiot) not\\r\\nmerely wastes his own property but practically embezzles that of his\\r\\nwife and daughter; the wife dies and the daughter is left alone with an\\r\\nextravagant establishment, a father practically non compos, not a\\r\\npenny in her pocket after she has paid his doctor, and a selfish\\r\\nbaronet-uncle who will do less than nothing to help her. She has loved\\r\\nhalf unconsciously, and been half consciously loved by, a soldier cousin\\r\\nor quasi-cousin: but he is in the Peninsular War. Absolutely no help\\r\\npresents itself but that of a Mr. Danby, a conveyancer, who, in some way\\r\\nnot very consonant with the usual etiquette of his profession, has been\\r\\nmixed up with her father\\'s affairs—a man middle-aged, apparently dry as\\r\\nhis own parchments, and quite unversed in society. He helps her clumsily\\r\\nbut lavishly: and her uncle forces her to accept his hand as the only\\r\\nmeans of saving her father from jail first and an asylum afterwards. The\\r\\ninevitable disunion, brought about largely by Danby\\'s mother (an awful\\r\\nold middle-class harridan), follows; and the desk-and-head incident\\r\\nmentioned above is brought about by her seeing the (false) announcement\\r\\nof her old lover\\'s death in the paper. But she herself is consistently,\\r\\nperhaps excessively, but it is fair to say not ridiculously, angelic;\\r\\nDanby is a gentleman and a good fellow at heart; and of course, after\\r\\nhighly tragical possibilities, these good gifts triumph. The greatest\\r\\ndanger is threatened, and the actual happy ending brought about, by an\\r\\nauxiliary plot, in which the actors are the old lover (two old lovers\\r\\nindeed), his wife (a beautiful featherhead, who has been Emilia\\'s\\r\\nschool-fellow and dearest friend), and a wicked \"Duke of C.\"\\nEven from this sketch the tolerably expert reader of novels may discover\\r\\nwhere the weak points are likely to lie; he will be a real expert if he\\r\\nanticipates the strong ones without knowing the book. As was formerly\\r\\nnoticed, the dialogue is ill supplied with diction. The date of the\\r\\nstory is 1809: and the author had for that period a fairly safe pattern\\r\\nin Miss Austen: but she does not use it at all, nor does she make the\\r\\nlingo frankly that of her own day. There are gross improbabilities—Mr.\\r\\nDanby, for instance (who is represented as wrapped up in his business,\\r\\nand exclusively occupied with the legal side of money matters and the\\r\\nmoney side of the law), actually discharges, or thinks he is\\r\\ndischarging, hundreds and thousands of Mr. Wyndham\\'s liabilities by\\r\\nhanding his own open cheques, not to the creditors, not to any one\\r\\nrepresenting them, but to a country attorney who has succeeded him in\\r\\nthe charge of the debts and affairs, and whom he knows to be a sharp\\r\\npractitioner and suspects to be a scoundrel. The inhuman uncle and the\\r\\nlicentious duke are mere cardboard characters: and the featherheaded\\r\\nLisa talks and behaves like a mixture of the sprightly heroines of\\r\\nRichardson (for whom Lady Mary most righteously prescribed a sound\\r\\nwhipping) and the gushing heroines of Lady Morgan. There is too much\\r\\nchaise-and-four and laudanum-bottle; too much moralising; too much of a\\r\\ngood many other things. And yet, somehow or other, there are also things\\r\\nvery rarely to be found in any novel—even taking in Bulwer and the\\r\\nserious part of Dickens—up to the date. The scene between Danby and his\\r\\nmother, in the poky house in Charlotte Street, when she discovers that\\r\\nhe has been giving a hundred-pound cheque to a young lady is\\r\\nimpressingly good: it is not absolutely unsuggestive of what Thackeray\\r\\nwas just doing, and really not far from what Trollope was not for some\\r\\nyears to do. There are other passages which make one think of George\\r\\nEliot, who indeed might have been writing at the very time; there are\\r\\neven faint and faltering suggestions of Ibsenic \"duty to ourselves.\" Mr.\\r\\nDanby (the characters regularly call each other \"Mr.,\" \"Mrs.,\" and\\r\\n\"Miss,\" even when they are husbands and wives, daughters or nieces, and\\r\\nuncles or fathers) is a miss, and not quite a miss, of a very striking,\\r\\noriginal, possible, and even probable character. His mother, with\\r\\nsomething more of the Dickensian type-character, can stand by her\\r\\nunpleasant self, and came ten years before \"the Campaigner.\" Susan, her\\r\\npleasanter servant, is equally self-sufficing, and came five years\\r\\nbefore Peggotty, to whom she is not without resemblances.28\\nBut it is not so much the merits on the one hand, or the defects on the\\r\\nother, of the book that deserve attention here and justify the place\\r\\ngiven to it: it is the general \"chip-the-shell\" character. The shell is\\r\\nonly being chipped: large patches of it still hamper the chicken, which\\r\\nis thus a half developed and half disfigured little animal. All sorts of\\r\\ndidactics, of Byronic-Bulwerish sentiment, of conventionalities of\\r\\nvarious kinds, still hold their place; the language, as we have said, is\\r\\ntraditional and hardly even that; and the characters are partly drawn\\r\\nfrom Noah\\'s Arks of various dates, partly from the stock company of the\\r\\ntoy theatre. On the other hand, besides the touches of modernity already\\r\\nmentioned, and assisting them, there is a great attention to\\r\\n\"interiors.\" The writer has, for her time, a more than promising sense\\r\\nof the incongruity between Empire dress and furniture and the style of\\r\\nGeorge II.: and the shabbiness or actual squalor of Charlotte Street and\\r\\nChancery Lane show that she had either been a very early and forward\\r\\nscholar of Dickens, or had discovered the thing on her own account. Her\\r\\nage may excuse some of the weak points, but it makes the presence of the\\r\\nstrong ones all the more remarkable: and it shows all the more forcibly\\r\\nhow the general influences which were to produce the great central\\r\\ngrowth of Victorian novel were at work, and at work almost violently, in\\r\\nthe business of pulling down the old as well as of building up the new.\\nOf that new novel it is not necessary to say much more. In the last\\r\\nfifty or sixty years of the nineteenth century it did, as it seems to\\r\\nme, very great things—so great that, putting poetry, which is supreme,\\r\\naside, there is no division of the world\\'s literature within a time at\\r\\nall comparable to its own which can much, if at all, excel it. It did\\r\\nthese great things because partly of the inscrutable laws which\\r\\ndetermined that a certain number of men and women of unusual power\\r\\nshould exist, and should devote themselves to it, partly of the less\\r\\nheroic-sounding fact that the general appetite of other men and\\r\\nwomenkind could make it worth while for these persons of genius and\\r\\ntalent not to do something else. But even so, the examination, rightly\\r\\nconducted, discovers more than a sufficient dose of nobility. For the\\r\\nnovel appeal is not, after all, to a mere blind animal thirst for\\r\\nsomething that will pass and kill time, for something that will drug or\\r\\nflutter or amuse. Beyond and above these things there is something else.\\r\\nThe very central cause and essence of it—most definitely and most\\r\\nkeenly felt by nobler spirits and cultivated intelligences, but also\\r\\ndimly and unconsciously animating very ordinary people—is the human\\r\\ndelight in humanity—the pleasure of seeing the men and women of long\\r\\npast ages living, acting, and speaking as they might have done, those of\\r\\nthe present living, acting, speaking as they do—but in each case with\\r\\nthe portrayal not as a mere copy of particulars, but influenced with\\r\\nthat spirit of the universal which is the secret and the charm of art.\\r\\nIt is because the novels of these years recognised and provided this\\r\\npleasure in a greater degree than those of the former period (except the\\r\\nproductions of a few masters) that they deserve the higher position\\r\\nwhich has been here assigned them. If the novels of any period, before\\r\\nor since or to come, have deserved, may or shall deserve, a lower\\r\\nplace—it is, and will be, because of their comparative or positive\\r\\nneglect of the combination of these conditions. Perhaps it is not easy\\r\\nto see what new country there is for the novel to conquer. But, as with\\r\\nother kinds of literature, there is practically no limit to its powers\\r\\nof working its actual domains. In the finest of its already existing\\r\\nexamples it hardly yields in accomplishment even to poetry; in that\\r\\ngreat secondary (if secondary) office of all Art—to redress the\\r\\napparent injustice, and console for the apparent unkindness, of\\r\\nNature—to serve as rest and refreshment between those exactions of life\\r\\nwhich, though neither unjust nor unkind, are burdensome, it has no equal\\r\\namong all the kinds of Art itself.\\n\\nINDEX\\n\\nAdam Bede,  249 \\r\\nAdams, W.,  259 \\r\\nAddison,  62,  63,  154,  253 \\nAdeline Mowbray,  173 \\r\\nAelfric,  5 \\nAgathos,  259 \\r\\nAinsworth, H.,  214 \\nAlton Locke,  245,  246 \\nAmadis,  30,  40,  41,  65 \\nAmelia,  110-112,  118,  137 n.\\nAmis and Amillion,  23 \\r\\nAmory, Thomas,  140-143 \\nAnabasis, The,  2 \\r\\nAnglo-Saxon, Romance in,  4-7 \\nAnna,  173 \\nAnna St. Ives,  167 \\nApollonius of Tyre,  2,  5 \\r\\nApuleius,  1-3,  5 \\r\\nArblay, Madame d\\', see Burney, F.\\nArcadia, The,  33,  36-38,  66 \\nAretina,  46 \\nArthour and Merlin,  16 \\r\\nArthurian Legend, the, chap. i. passim;\\nits romantic concentration,  15-17,  24-31 \\nAsk Mamma,  193 n.\\nAss, The Golden,  3,  5 \\nAtlantis, The New,  133 \\r\\nAusten, Miss,  71,  110,  155, chap. v. passim,  230,  238,  253, 298 sq.\\n\\nBadman, Mr.,  54 \\r\\nBage, R.,  164-166 \\r\\nBalzac,  35,  122,  186,  278-280 \\r\\nBanim,  224 \\nBarchester Towers,  251 \\r\\nBarrett, E.S.,  180,  181 \\nBarry Lyndon,  231 \\r\\n\"Barsetshire Novels,\" the,  250-253 \\nBattle of the Books, The,  72 \\r\\nBeaconsfield, Lord, see Disraeli, B.\\r\\nBeckford,  158,  159 \\r\\nBehn, Afra,  48,  50-53 \\nBelinda,  182 \\r\\nBennett, Mrs.,  173 \\nBentivolio and Urania,  53 n.\\nBeowulf,  5,  6 \\r\\nBergerac, C. de,  73 \\r\\nBerington, S.,  134 \\r\\nBerkeley,  134 n.\\r\\nBerners, Lord,  30 \\nBertrams, The,  252 n.\\nBeryn, The Tale of,  31 \\r\\nBesaut, Sir W.,  288-290 \\nBetsy Thoughtless,  136-138 \\nBevis of Hampton,  22 \\r\\nBlack, W.,  287-288 \\r\\nBlackmore, R.D.,  274,  284-286 \\r\\nBlair,  156 \\r\\nBorrow, George,  142,  255 \\r\\nBoyle, Roger, Lord Broghill and Earl of Orrery,  44-46 \\nBrambletye House,  208,  214 \\r\\nBrontë, Charlotte,  199,  243;\\nEmily and Anne,  243 \\r\\nBrooke, H.,  146 \\r\\nBrunetière, M.,  122 \\r\\nBrunton, Mrs.,  177 \\r\\nBulwer, Sir E.B.

But, as a novel, it cannot count these.\\n Footnote 2: (return)\\nIt is pleasant to remember that one of the chief publishers\\r\\n    of these things in the late seventeenth century was W.\\r\\n    Thackeray. \\n Footnote 3: (return)\\n\"Quant à moi, je trouve les choses que ces messieurs se\\r\\n    disent fort bien dites et tout à fait dignes de deux\\r\\n    gentilhommes.\"\\n Footnote 4: (return)\\nHe has a name, Meriton Latroon, but it is practically\\r\\n    never used in the actual story.\\n Footnote 5: (return)\\nThe heroic kind had lent itself very easily and obviously to\\r\\n    allegory. Not very long before Bunyan English literature had\\r\\n    been enriched with a specimen of this double variety which for\\r\\n    Sir W. Raleigh \"marks the lowest depth to which English romance\\r\\n    writing sank.\" I do not know that I could go quite so far as\\r\\n    this in regard to the book—Bentivolio and Urania by Nathaniel\\r\\n    Ingelo. The first edition of this appeared in 1660: the second\\r\\n    (there seem to have been at least four) lies before me at this\\r\\n    moment dated 1669, or nine years before the Progress itself.\\r\\n    You require a deep-sea-lead of uncommonly cunning construction\\r\\n    to sound, register, and compare the profundities of the bathos\\r\\n    in novels. The book has about 400 folio pages very closely\\r\\n    packed with type, besides an alphabetical index full of Hebrew\\r\\n    and Greek derivations of its names—\"Gnothisauton,\" \"Achamoth,\"\\r\\n    \"Ametameletus,\" \"Dogmapernes,\" and so forth. Its principles are\\r\\n    inexorably virtuous; there is occasional action interspersed\\r\\n    among its innumerable discourses, and I think it not improbable\\r\\n    that if it were only possible to read it, it might do one some\\r\\n    good. But it would not be the good of the novel.\\n Footnote 6: (return)\\nThis is said not to have been quite the case at the very\\r\\n    first: but it has been so since.\\n Footnote 7: (return)\\nA little of the work to be noticed in this chapter is not\\r\\n    strictly eighteenth century, but belongs to the first decade or\\r\\n    so of the nineteenth. But the majority of the contents actually\\r\\n    conform to the title, and there is hardly any more convenient or\\r\\n    generally applicable heading for the novel before Miss Austen\\r\\n    and Scott, excluding the great names dealt with in the last\\r\\n    chapter.\\n Footnote 8: (return)\\nThe not infrequent attribution of this book to Berkeley is a\\r\\n    good instance of the general inability to discriminate style.\\n Footnote 9: (return)\\nThe elect ladies about Richardson joined Betsy with\\r\\n    Amelia, and sneered at both.\\n Footnote 10: (return)\\nIt has been observed, and is worth observing, that the\\r\\n    eighteenth-century hero, even in his worst circumstances, can\\r\\n    seldom exist without a \"follower.\"\\n Footnote 11: (return)\\nJulia Mannering reminds me a little of Julia Townsend: and\\r\\n    if this be doubtful, the connection of Jerry\\'s \"Old madam gave\\r\\n    me some higry-pigry\" and Cuddie\\'s \"the leddy cured me with some\\r\\n    hickery-pickery\" is not. While, for Dickens, compare the way in\\r\\n    which Sam Weller\\'s landlord in the Fleet got into trouble with\\r\\n    the Tinker\\'s Tale in Spiritual Quixote, bk. iv. chap. ii.\\n Footnote 12: (return)\\nAlso, perhaps, to one who had not yet discovered that\\r\\n    intense concentration on herself and her family with which,\\r\\n    after their quarrel, Mrs. Thrale, not quite an impartial judge,\\r\\n    but a very shrewd one, charged her, and which does appear in the\\r\\n    Diary.\\n Footnote 13: (return)\\nDunlop and others have directly or indirectly suggested a\\r\\n    good deal of plagiarism in Evelina from Miss Betsy\\r\\n    Thoughtless: but it is exactly in this life-quality that the\\r\\n    earlier novelist fails.\\n Footnote 14: (return)\\nSince the text was written—indeed very recently—the\\r\\n    long-missing \"Episodes\" of Vathek itself have been at length\\r\\n    supplied by the welcome diligence of Mr. Lewis Melville. They\\r\\n    are not \"better than Vathek,\" but they are good.\\n Footnote 15: (return)\\nGodwin had written novel-juvenilia of which few say\\r\\n    anything.\\n Footnote 16: (return)\\nThe peculiar pedantic ignorance which critics sometimes\\r\\n    show has objected to this rendering of Marmontel\\'s Contes\\r\\n    Moraux, urging that it should read \"tales of manners.\" It\\r\\n    might be enough to remark that the Edgeworths, father and\\r\\n    daughter, were probably a good deal better acquainted both with\\r\\n    French and English than these cavillers. But there is a\\r\\n    rebutting argument which is less ad hominem. \"Tales of\\r\\n    Manners\" leaves out at least as much on one side as \"Moral\\r\\n    Tales\" does on the other: and the actual meaning is quite clear\\r\\n    to those who know that of the Latin mores and the French\\r\\n    moeurs. It is scarcely worth while to attempt to help those\\r\\n    who do not know by means of paraphrases.\\n Footnote 17: (return)\\nThe frankness of the ingenious creator of Mr. Jorrocks\\r\\n    should be imitated by 99 per cent. of English novelists. \"The\\r\\n    following story,\" says he of Ask Mamma, \"does not involve the\\r\\n    complication of a plot. It is a mere continuous narrative.\"\\n Footnote 18: (return)\\nThose who are curious about the matter will find it\\r\\n    treated in a set of Essays by the present writer, which\\r\\n    originally appeared in Macmillan\\'s Magazine during the autumn\\r\\n    of 1894, and were reprinted among Essays in English\\r\\n    Literature, Second Series, London, 1895.\\n Footnote 19: (return)\\nSome work of distinction, actually later than hers in date,\\r\\n    is older in kind. This is the case not only with the later books\\r\\n    of her Irish elder sister. Miss Edgeworth (see last chapter),\\r\\n    but with all those of her Scotch younger one, Miss Ferrier, who\\r\\n    wrote Marriage just after Sense and Sensibility appeared,\\r\\n    but did not publish it (1818) till after Miss Austen\\'s death,\\r\\n    following it with The Inheritance (1824) and Destiny (1831).\\r\\n    Miss Ferrier, who had a strong though rather hard humour and\\r\\n    great faculty of pronounced character-drawing, is better at a\\r\\n    series of sketches than at a complete novel—only The\\r\\n    Inheritance having much central unity. And there is still\\r\\n    eighteenth-century quality rather than nineteenth in her\\r\\n    alternations of Smollettian farce-satire and Mackenziefied\\r\\n    sentiment. She is very good to read, but stand a little out of\\r\\n    the regular historic succession, as well as out of the ordinary\\r\\n    novel classes.\\n Footnote 20: (return)\\nHere and in a good many cases to come it is impossible to\\r\\n    particularise criticism. It matters the less that, from\\r\\n    Ainsworth\\'s Rookwood (1834) and James\\' Richelieu (1829)\\r\\n    onwards, the work of both was very much par sibi in merit and\\r\\n    defect alike.\\n Footnote 21: (return)\\nIt has not been thought necessary to insert criticism of\\r\\n    Dickens\\'s individual novels. They are almost all well known to\\r\\n    almost everybody: and special discussion of them would be\\r\\n    superfluous, while their general characteristics and positions\\r\\n    in novel-history are singularly uniform and can be described\\r\\n    together.\\n Footnote 22: (return)\\nFor this reason, and for the variety of kind of his later\\r\\n    novels a little more individual notice must be given to them\\r\\n    than in the case of Dickens, but still only a little, and\\r\\n    nothing like detailed criticism.\\n Footnote 23: (return)\\nEdgar Poe has a perfectly serious and very characteristic\\r\\n    explosion at the prominence of these agreeable viands in the\\r\\n    book.\\n Footnote 24: (return)\\nSome will have it that this was really Charlotte\\'s: but not\\r\\n    with much probability.\\n Footnote 25: (return)\\nIt is curious to compare this (dealing as it does largely\\r\\n    with sport) and the \"Jorrocks\" series of Robert Surtees\\r\\n    (1803-1864). Kingsley was nearly as practical a sportsman as\\r\\n    Surtees: but Surtees\\'s characters and manners have the old\\r\\n    artificial-picaresque quality only.\\n Footnote 26: (return)\\nHis most ambitious studies in strict character are the\\r\\n    closely connected heroines of The Bertrams (1859) and Can you\\r\\n    Forgive Her? (1864-1865). But the first-named book has never\\r\\n    been popular; and the other hardly owes its popularity to the\\r\\n    heroine.\\n Footnote 27: (return)\\nAnthony Trollope, in one of the discursive passages in his\\r\\n    early books, has left positive testimony to the distaste with\\r\\n    which publishers regarded it.\\n Footnote 28: (return)\\nAnother novel of Mrs. Marsh-Caldwell\\'s, Norman\\'s Bridge,\\r\\n    has strong suggestions of John Halifax, and is ten years\\r\\n    older.\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 14469 ***\\n\\n\\n'"
